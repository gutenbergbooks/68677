<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
THE LITTLE BED-ROOM.
</h3>

<p>
Dr. Vale had the prettiest house in all Chatford.
It was a tasteful, white cottage, with a
green lawn in front, and tall elm trees about
it.  The side windows looked out upon a
pleasant orchard, where the smooth, ripe apples
peeped temptingly from their beds of fresh
leaves.  At one of these windows there was a
neat curtain, that was looped back one summer
evening, while through the open casement there
floated the perfume of the rose bush that had
climbed the cottage wall, until its buds could
look in at the upper window.  A pretty sight
there was within! the moonlight streamed on
the floor, and lit up as sweet a little bed-room
as any fairy could desire.  The small
counterpane and bureau-cover were white as snow, on
the tiny work-table there was a vase of fresh
flowers, and the miniature book-case was filled
with an interesting collection of nicely-bound
volumes.  There was nothing wanting to give
the apartment an air of perfect taste and comfort.
</p>

<p>
Did the young owner enjoy that pleasant
room?  Young she must have been, for
everything, even to the low rocking-chair, was
evidently prepared for the use of some favoured
child.
</p>

<p>
Presently the door opened, but no one
entered.  Lucy Vale, the doctor's youngest
daughter, stood timidly without.  Surely there
was nothing frightful in that quiet room? yet
she did not venture in until the light was so
steady that she could see plainly into its
farthest corners.  As soon, as she had locked the
door behind her, she looked into the closet,
behind the curtain, under the bed, and even
under the bureau, where nothing thicker than
a turtle could possibly have hidden itself.
</p>

<p>
There had not been a robbery in the peaceful
village of Chatford in the memory of the oldest
inhabitant, so there was no danger of Lucy's
disturbing any villain in his hiding-place.  If
she had chanced to find the thief she seemed so
earnestly seeking, she would have been in a
most unfortunate position, as her bed-room
door was locked, and, without any weapon,
her feeble arm would have been but poor
protection.
</p>

<p>
Children who never go to sleep without
hunting for robbers, seldom think what they
would do if they should at last succeed in
finding one, nicely stowed away in a closet.
Few thieves are so hardened as to injure a
sleeping child, while the most cowardly might
be led to strike a blow on being suddenly
discovered, and placed in danger of punishment.
After all, even if there were thieves in a house,
the safest course for a child would be to go
quietly to sleep, and leave the evil men to steal
and depart.
</p>

<p>
Lucy Vale did not seem quite satisfied with
her first search; again she furtively glanced
about, before she sat down to read the chapter
in the Bible, which she had been taught never
to omit at night.  Lucy read her Bible as a
duty, not because she loved it, or wished to
learn the will of God, and now she could not
fix her attention at all upon its sacred pages.
</p>

<p>
She was hardly seated when a slight sound
in the orchard attracted her notice; she jumped
up and ran to the window.  All was quiet in
that peaceful scene, save the occasional dropping
of the ripe fruit.  The shadows of the leaves
quivered in the moonlight in what seemed to
her a mysterious manner; a strange feeling of
fear stole over her; she did not return to the
Bible, but having hastily undressed, she fell
upon her knees for her evening prayer.  Lucy
would have thought it very wicked to go to
sleep without what she called saying her
prayers.  In truth it was only <i>saying</i> them, for
while she repeated the solemn words, her
thoughts were far away.  Sometimes she would
get so busily thinking of other things, that her
lips would cease to move, and she would remain
on her knees, buried in thought, for many
minutes.  As soon as she remembered why
she was kneeling, she would hurry over the
remainder of her prayers and go to bed, quite
satisfied that she had done her duty.
</p>

<p>
On this particular evening her prayers were
soon over, and she was quickly in bed, leaving
the lamp burning; its light however was of
but little use to her, as she thrust her head
under the covering, hardly leaving space
enough to breathe through.
</p>

<p>
If Mrs. Maxwell, the housekeeper, had
known that Lucy kept her light burning at
night, she would have scolded her severely,
for she often said, "it was flying in the face of
nature to try to make night like day, and for
her part she thought it downright wicked to
be wasting oil when everybody was asleep, to
say nothing of the danger of fire."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Vale had lost his wife when Lucy was
just six years old, and since that time
Mrs. Maxwell had been his housekeeper; he trusted
everything to her, and she seemed to take the
greatest delight in being economical, that none
of her master's substance might be wasted.
She was not bad-tempered, but she had a stern,
harsh manner, and was easily worried by children,
only thinking them good when they were
silent and stirred neither hand nor foot.  Lucy
seldom came near her without being blamed for
something, or told to sit down and be quiet.
</p>

<p>
The little girl would have been quite lonely
had it not been for her brother Hartwell, who
was just two years older than herself.  Lucy
was now ten, but Hartwell seemed to think her
a very little child, hardly fit to be his
companion, yet he would sometimes permit her to
play with him, and a dearly-bought pleasure
it was.  Harty, as he was generally called, was
indolent; he could not bear to move about, and
therefore found it very convenient to have Lucy
to wait upon him.  He never seemed to have
thought his sister might not like running up
and down stairs any better than he did.  It
was so easy when he wanted anything to tell
Lucy to run for it, that sometimes he kept her
little feet in such constant motion that at night
she was quite tired out.  If she ever
complained, he told her, girls were made to wait
on boys, and if she could not do such trifles for
him she had better go to her doll-baby and not
be about in his way.  Lucy loved her brother,
and liked to be near him, so she seldom refused
to do what he asked her, although he often
called her disobliging when she had been trying
her best to please him.
</p>

<p>
Hartwell was very fond of teasing, and his
poor little sister had to suffer for his
amusement.  Sometimes he would make her cry, by
telling her that she was so ugly that it was
painful to look at her; at others he would call
her a coward, and run after her to put insects
on her neck, or he would jump out from a dark
corner and shout in her ear when she thought
herself quite alone.
</p>

<p>
As you will conclude, Lucy did not lead a
very happy life.  Her father was so constantly
occupied that he seldom took his meals with
the family, and sometimes hardly spoke to his
little daughter for days together.  She had no
one to whom she could talk freely; Mrs. Maxwell
never listened to her, and her brother
was so apt to laugh at what she said, that she
did not dare to tell him many things that
troubled her.  She was naturally a timid child,
but since her mother's death she had grown so
bashful that she could hardly answer when a
stranger spoke to her.  Many of her childish
fears, which a kind friend in the beginning
could easily have banished, had become so strong
that she lived in perpetual alarm.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
THE THUNDER-SHOWER.
</h3>

<p>
About midnight Lucy was roused by a loud
clap of thunder.  The rain was dashing in
through the open window, and the waning
lamp seemed but a spark amid the almost
incessant flashes of lightning.  The poor child
trembled with fear, she dared not close the
window, and yet the flying drops almost
reached her little bed.  She lay in an agony
of terror, thinking that every moment might
be her last.  The idea of death was horrible
to her: in broad daylight, or when pleasantly
occupied, she could forget that she must die;
but any sudden fright would bring the solemn
truth to her mind and fill her with distress.
She had never heard Mrs. Maxwell or Harty
speak of being afraid of death, and dared not
mention her fear to them, and with her father
she was so shy, that he knew very little of what
was passing in her mind.
</p>

<p>
The many faults of which she had been
guilty rose to her mind in that awful storm,
and she resolved if her life were spared never
to do wrong again.  After making this resolution
she felt a little comforted, and began to
think what could be done about the window.
She got up and took the lamp to go and call
some one to her assistance.  But whom should
she call?  "I will not disturb father," she
said to herself, "he was so very tired last
night; Harty will laugh at me for not doing it
myself; and Mrs. Maxwell&mdash;I cannot wake
her, she will be so very angry."  Thus thinking,
she stood irresolutely in the hall, starting
at every flash of lightning, and afraid either to
go forward or return.  Just then Mrs. Maxwell
opened her door: "What are you about there?"
said she, with an astonished look at Lucy.
</p>

<p>
"Please, ma'am," said the little girl, who
was really glad to see a human face, "will you
shut my window?"
</p>

<p>
"Why in the name of wonder did not you
shut it yourself?" was the response.  Lucy
was silent, and they entered the room, together.
"A pretty piece of work!" said the neat
housekeeper, holding tip both hands, as her
eyes fell on the soaking carpet.  She shut the
window hastily, and then said to Lucy, "Come
to my room, for it wouldn't be safe for any one
to sleep in that damp place."
</p>

<p>
Lucy was so much afraid of Mrs. Maxwell,
that it was quite a trial to be in the same bod
with her; she crept close to the wall, not daring
to go to sleep, lest she should be restless, and
wake the stern woman at her side.  She had
many serious thoughts that night, and again
and again resolved never more to do wrong.
</p>

<p>
Towards morning she had a pleasant nap,
from which she was roused by the morning
bell.  The sun was shining cheerfully into the
room, and the wild storm of the night seemed
like a painful dream.  She dressed herself
carefully, and knelt to say her morning prayer,
simple words which she had repeated a thousand
times with as little thought as if they had been
without sense or meaning.  Those same words,
spoken with earnest sincerity, would have called
down a blessing from Him who loves to listen
when children truly pray.  Lucy had not
forgotten her resolution to do right, but she
trusted in her own feeble efforts.
</p>

<p>
A flush of pleasure lit the usually pale face
of the little girl as she saw her father seated
at the breakfast-table.  She glided into the
chair next him, and hardly ate anything, she
was so busily occupied in watching his plate,
and placing all he might need beside him.
Harty, meanwhile, showed his delight in his
father's company by being more talkative than
usual.  He had taken a long walk in the fresh
morning air, and had many things to tell about
what he had seen.  What had interested him
most was a tall tree, which the recent lightning
had struck and splintered from the topmost
bough to the root.
</p>

<p>
Lucy shuddered as the conversation brought
the painful scene of the night afresh to her
mind.  It revived Mrs. Maxwell's memory
also, for she turned to Lucy with a stern look,
and said, "How came you with a light last
night?"
</p>

<p>
Lucy blushed, and hastily answered, "I
forgot to put it out when I went to bed."
</p>

<p>
"Careless child!" was Mrs. Maxwell's only
reply; but nothing that she could have said
would have made Lucy more unhappy than the
fault she had just committed.  What would
she not have given, a few moments after, to
recall those false words; but they had been
spoken, and recorded in the book of God!
</p>

<p>
During breakfast Dr. Vale looked anxiously
many times at the little girl at his side.  There
was nothing of cheerful childhood in her
appearance; her slender figure was slightly bent,
and her small face was pale and thin; her eyes
were cast down, and she only occasionally
looked up timidly from under the long lashes.
Her little mouth was closed too tightly, and
her whole expression was so sad and subdued,
that he was truly troubled about it.  It was
plain to any one who looked at her that she
was not happy.
</p>

<p>
The doctor dearly loved his children.  Harty
he could understand, but Lucy was a mystery
to him.  He felt certain that she loved him,
for she never disobeyed him, and when he was
with her she was sure to nestle at his side, and
take his hand in hers; but she seldom talked
to him, and was growing daily more silent and
shy.
</p>

<p>
"Something must be done for her," he
inwardly said.  His thoughts were interrupted
by Harty's calling out, "Why don't you eat
something, Lucy?  There, let me butter the
baby some bread."  Rude as this remark
seemed, it was meant in kindness.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want anything, Harty," answered
the sister.  "Nonsense!" said he; "you are
thin enough already: one of the boys asked
me the other day, if my sister fed on
broom-splinters, for she looked like one;" and the
thoughtless boy gave a loud laugh.
</p>

<p>
It would have been much better for Lucy
if she could have laughed too, but the tears
filled her eyes, and she pettishly replied, "I
should not care what I was, if it was only
something that could not be laughed at."
</p>

<p>
At this Harty only shouted the louder.
"Hush, Harty," said Dr. Vale; "for shame,
to tease your sister.  Don't mind him, Lucy,"
and he drew his arm tenderly around her.
She laid her head on his lap, and cried
bitterly.  This kindness from her father would
usually have made her quite happy, but now
the falsehood she had first uttered made her feel
so guilty that she could not bear his gentle
manner.  She longed to tell him all&mdash;her fault
of the morning, her terror of the night
before&mdash;all she had thought and suffered for so many
weary days; but her lips would not move, and
she only continued to sob.  A ring at the bell
called the father away, or she might have
gained courage to open her heart to him.  If
Lucy could have been more with him, she
would have found a friend who would have
listened to all her little trials, and given her
the truest consolation and advice.  It was a
source of sorrow to Dr. Vale that he could
be so little with his family, and on this
particular morning he felt it with unusual force.
</p>

<p>
"My little daughter is going on badly,"
he said to himself, as he entered his chaise,
to make his round of visits.  "The child is
losing all her spirits; she needs a different
companion from Harty; he is too boisterous,
too much of a tease for my little flower.
Mrs. Maxwell is not the person to make a child
cheerful; I must have Rosa at home."  The
doctor was prompt to act when he had fixed
upon a plan, and that day a letter was written
to his eldest daughter, recalling her home.  For
three years before her mother's death, and
since that time, Rosa had been under the care
of her uncle, the Rev. Mr. Gillette.  This
gentleman had been obliged by ill-health to
give up the exercise of his holy profession,
but he did not cease to devote himself to his
Master's cause.  He received a few young
ladies into his family, whose education he
conducted with all the earnestness of a father.
His chief aim was to lead his pupils in the
pleasant paths of virtue, and make them to
know and love the Lord.  Rosa, as the child
of his departed sister, had been peculiarly dear
to him; he had spared no pains in moulding
her character, and was now beginning to see
the fruits of his labour in the daily improvement
of his attractive niece.  To Rosa, then,
whom we shall soon know better, the doctor's
letter was immediately sent.
</p>

<p>
Lucy, meanwhile, had no idea of the change
that was soon to take place in her home.  She
passed a sad day, for the remembrance of the
untruth she had spoken hung about her like
a dark cloud.  She had been taught that a
lie was hateful to God, and sure to bring
punishment.  Mrs. Maxwell had made it a
part of her duty to hear Lucy recite the
Catechism every Sunday.  These were trying times
to the little girl, for the eye of the questioner
was constantly fixed upon her; and if she
failed or faltered in one of the long answers,
she was sent to her room to study there
until she could go through the part without
hesitation.  Mrs. Maxwell generally closed the
Sunday evening exercise by telling Lucy how
dreadful a thing it was to be a bad child,
and that God saw her every moment, and
would punish every wicked act she committed.
From these conversations Lucy would go away
in tears, resolved never to do wrong again;
but these resolutions soon passed from her
mind, until recalled by some fright or by the
lesson of the next Sunday evening.
</p>

<p>
She only thought of God as an awful
Judge, who would take delight in punishing
her, and was far happier when she could
forget Him.

CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
THE MEDICINE.
</h3>

<p>
The morning light streamed pleasantly into
Lucy's pretty room, and there was the little
girl quite dressed, and moving about as busily
as Mrs. Maxwell herself.  She had been up
since the dew-drops began to sparkle in the
sunlight.  She could not make up her mind
to confess her fault to her father or
Mrs. Maxwell, but she was determined to be so
very good as to quite make up for it.  In the
first place, she would put her room in order;
that would please Mrs. Maxwell.
</p>

<p>
With a tremendous effort she turned her
little bed, and then spread up the clothes with
the greatest care.  It was her first attempt
in that way, and not very successful, but she
was quite satisfied with it, and walked about
surveying it as if it had been a masterpiece
of housewifery.
</p>

<p>
The doctor was again at the breakfast-table,
and he was pleased to see his little daughter
looking so much more cheerful.  Harty, as
usual, was in excellent spirits; but his father's
rebuke was still fresh in his mind, and he
refrained from teasing his sister, and
contented himself with telling funny stories about
school occurrences, until even Mrs. Maxwell
was forced to laugh.
</p>

<p>
As they rose from the table, Dr. Vale
handed Lucy a small parcel, saying, "Take
good care of this, my dear, and leave it at
Mrs. Tappan's on your way to school; it is
some medicine for her, which she will need
at ten o'clock.  I have a long ride to take
in another direction, so good morning, my
little mouse."  Having kissed her affectionately,
he jumped into his chaise, and was soon
out of sight.
</p>

<p>
Lucy was unusually happy when she started
for school; Harty had not teased her,
Mrs. Maxwell had not found fault with her, and
her father had trusted her with something to
do for him.
</p>

<p>
The summer sky was clear above her, and
her feet made not a sound as she tripped
over the soft grass.  The wild rose bushes
offered her a sweet bouquet, and she plucked
a cluster of buds as she passed.  In the
pleasure of that bright morning, Lucy forgot her
good resolutions.  She did not think of her
kind Heavenly Father while enjoying His
beautiful world.  Fear alone brought Him to
her mind: she remembered Him in the storm,
but forgot Him in the sunshine.
</p>

<p>
Lucy was soon at Mrs. Tappan's gate, and
was raising the latch, when the large
house-dog came down the walk and stood directly
in the way.  She thought he looked very
fierce, and did not dare to pass him.  She
walked on a short distance and then came
back, hoping he would be gone; but no, he
had not moved an inch.  While she was doubting
what to do, the school-bell rang; thrusting
the parcel into her pocket, she hurried on,
saying to herself, "As it is so late, I am sure
father will not blame me."
</p>

<p>
She was hardly seated in school, however,
before she began to be troubled about what she
had done.  "Perhaps Mrs. Tappan was very
ill," she thought; the shutters were all closed,
and her father had called there twice the day
before, and had already seen her that morning.
With such thoughts in her mind, of course Lucy
did not learn her lesson; although she held the
book in her hand, and seemed to have her eyes
fixed upon it.  When she was called up to
recite, she blundered, hesitated, and utterly
failed.  The tears now filled her eyes.  Glancing
at the clock, she saw that it yet wanted a
quarter of ten.
</p>

<p>
"Please, Miss Parker, may I go home?"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Are you unwell?" asked the teacher,
kindly.
</p>

<p>
"No," murmured Lucy.
</p>

<p>
"Then go to your seat," said Miss Parker, a
little sternly; "and never ask me again to let
you go home unless you have a good reason."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't mind her, she's as cross as she
can be," whispered Julia Staples, as she took
her seat at Lucy's side.
</p>

<p>
Lucy knew Miss Parker was not cross, yet
she felt a little comforted by Julia's seeming
interested in her trouble, and placed her hand
in hers under the desk, as if to thank her new
friend; for Julia Staples had seldom spoken to
her before.
</p>

<p>
Wearily the hours of school passed away.
At last the clock struck one, and the children
were dismissed.  Lucy was hurrying off, when
Julia Staples called after her to wait, for she
was going that way.  Lucy did not like to be
disobliging, and therefore stood still until her
companion was quite ready.
</p>

<p>
"I hate school, don't you?" said Julia, as
they walked along.
</p>

<p>
Now Lucy did not hate school, she generally
found it very pleasant; but she thought it
would seem childish to say so to a large girl
like Julia Staples; so she answered, rather
awkwardly, "Yes, I did not like it to-day."
</p>

<p>
"I can't bear Miss Parker," continued Julia,
"she's so partial; I know you don't like her,
from the way you looked at her this morning."
</p>

<p>
Lucy did like Miss Parker, for she had often
drawn the little girl to her side, and spoken
very tenderly to her, more tenderly than any
one had done since her own mother's death,
and she was therefore glad that they came that
moment to the road which led to Julia's home,
for there they must part.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning," said Julia, not waiting for
an answer; "I shall call for you to-morrow,"
and Lucy went on her way alone.  She had been
almost led to speak unkindly of a person she
really loved, because she was afraid to say
boldly what was in her mind.
</p>

<p>
As she came in sight of Mrs. Tappan's quiet
house, she saw her father coming out of the
gate, looking thoughtfully on the ground.  He
did not see her, and she had to run very fast to
overtake him before he got into his chaise.
</p>

<p>
"Father! dear father!" she said, "do stop
a minute; is Mrs. Tappan very ill?  Do not be
angry with me, here is the medicine."
</p>

<p>
The doctor looked quite serious while Lucy
told him of her fright in the morning, and her
sorrow after she reached school at not having
delivered the medicine.  The dreaded dog was
standing within the gate while they were talking
without; the doctor called him and made Lucy
look into his mild eye and pat him gently.
"You see, my dear," said the father, as the
hand of the little girl rested on the head of the
quiet animal, "that you need not have been
afraid of Rover.  You should have remembered
that in not delivering the medicine you might
be doing more harm to another than the dog
would have done to you.  Even after you were
at school, all might have been well if you had
had the courage to tell the whole truth to your
teacher; she would certainly have excused you.
I cannot say what will be the consequence of
your foolish timidity.  Mrs. Tappan is very ill!"
</p>

<p>
As her father spoke these words, Lucy's tears
fell fast.  Not another syllable was spoken
until they reached home.  Harty came out to
meet them, calling out to his sister, "Are those
red eyes the sign of bad lessons?"  She made
him no reply, but hastened to her room to think
on her own folly, and poor Mrs. Tappan.
</p>

<p>
It was a long afternoon to the little girl; her
dinner was sent to her, and she remained alone
until dark.  This was the day which had
commenced so pleasantly, and in which Lucy had
intended to please everybody.  Alas! the poor
child had not asked God's help to enable her to
do her duty, nor had she been faithful in her
own exertions.
</p>

<p>
When the tea-bell rang, she hastened down
stairs, hoping to hear from her father good
news about Mrs. Tappan, but he did not appear.
Harty seeing his sister look so unhappy,
forbore to tease her, and the meal passed over in
silence.  Eight o'clock came, and Mrs. Maxwell
gave Lucy her light, and told her to go to bed.
She did not dare to ask to sit up a little longer,
for she knew the request would not be granted.
Feeling like a criminal, the little girl went to
her room&mdash;that pretty room, how many unhappy
hours she had passed there! but none more
wretched than on that evening.
</p>

<p>
In vain she tried to sleep.  Whenever she
closed her eyes, the form of the sick woman
would rise before her, and she could almost
fancy she heard her groans.  Nine o'clock
struck, and ten, yet Lucy was awake.  About
eleven she heard the street-door open; then
there was a careful step upon the stairs, and
some one moved towards the doctor's room.
She was out of bed in an instant, and hastening
towards the door.  It was locked as usual, and
before she could open it, her father had passed.
She almost flew along the passage, and sought
his arm as he was entering his room.  He
clasped her to his breast and kissed her
tenderly, saying at the same time, what she so
much wished to hear, "Thank God, Mrs. Tappan
is out of danger.  You ought to be very grateful,"
he continued, "my dear child, that your
fault has led to no evil; I trust that this will
teach you not to let childish fears lead you to
neglect your duty!"  Much relieved she returned
to her own room, but no thanks were uplifted
from her young heart to Him who had been
pleased to spare the stroke of death.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
AN ANNOUNCEMENT.
</h3>

<p>
All the family at the cottage were awake at
sunrise the next morning, and there was an
unusual bustle throughout the house.
Mrs. Maxwell was flying about with a duster in her
hand, giving her orders to the servants, and
working twice as busily as any of them.  The
large room opposite to Lucy's was open, and
being put in thorough order.  This room had
been occupied by Lucy's mother during her
illness, and had been kept closed since her
death.  It had always seemed a gloomy place
to the little girl; she had peeped in when the
door chanced to be open to air the apartment.
Now it was undergoing an entire change; the
shutters, so long fastened, were thrown back,
and muslin curtains fluttered in the morning
breeze; neat covers had been placed on the
dark bureau and table; and on the latter
Mrs. Maxwell was placing a large India work-box
that had belonged to Mrs. Vale, and which
Lucy had not seen since she was a very little
child.
</p>

<p>
Before going down to breakfast, she stepped
in to see the pleasant change more closely; she
was startled by meeting a mild glance from a
sweet face on the wall.  It was her mamma's
portrait that looked thus gently upon her, and
she almost expected the kind face to bend down
to kiss her, as it had been wont to do when
that dear mamma was alive.  Lucy had never
seen this picture before, and she could not help
wondering where it had come from, and why it
was placed there, where none of the family
could see it.  Indeed, she was thoroughly
puzzled to understand what could be the cause
of all this commotion in the usually quiet house.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell poured out coffee in silence,
and Lucy asked no questions; but before they
rose from the table, Harty came bounding into
the room, crying, "Guess who is coming here, Lucy."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it cousin Jack?" asked Lucy, almost
sighing to think what a life she should lead
with the two boys to tease her.
</p>

<p>
"Guess again," said Harty; and she did
guess all the aunts, cousins, and friends that
had ever been to make them a visit, but in
vain.  When Harty had enjoyed her curiosity
long enough, he said, "Well, Miss Mouse" (a
name he often called her), "sister Rosa is
coming home to live, and she is to tell us what
to do, and be like a little mother for us!  That's
what father told me."
</p>

<p>
Lucy did not know whether to be glad or
sorry at this news; she had not seen her sister
for many years, and perhaps she might be
afraid of her, and perhaps Rosa might not care
for such a little girl as herself, even younger
than Harty.
</p>

<p>
The excited boy was in a state of great
delight, and he talked to Lucy until she quite
entered into his feelings.  "Won't it be nice,"
he said, "to have Rosa at home?  I shall offer
her my arm when she goes to church, and lead
you with the other hand.  I shall lend her my
'Swiss Family Robinson;' I mean to put it in
her room, that she may read it whenever she
pleases.  But she need not attempt to make me
mind her, for I sha'n't do it; I am not going to
have any girl set over me!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, fie!  Harty!" said Lucy, "to speak so
of sister Rosa before you have seen her."
</p>

<p>
"Before I have seen her!" repeated Harty;
"I remember her perfectly; I have not
forgotten how I used to play&mdash;she was my
horse&mdash;and drive her round the house; you were
only a little baby then."
</p>

<p>
"Not so very little," answered Lucy, pettishly,
for her brother had made her feel as if it
were a disgrace to be young.
</p>

<p>
While they were talking, Julia Staples called
to walk with her to school.  Lucy soon told her
all about her sister's expected return.
</p>

<p>
"I should not think you would like it!"
said Julia; "she'll want the nicest of everything
for herself, and make you wait on her, as
if you were her servant."
</p>

<p>
Before they reached the school-house, Lucy
was quite sure that Rosa's coming would make
her unhappy.  Julia Staples had been talking
with little thought, but she had roused evil
feelings in Lucy's mind which were strangers
there.  She was not naturally envious, but now
her heart burned at the idea that her sister
would always be praised, and go out with her
father, while she would be left at home with no
one to care for her.  Children do not think
enough of the harm they may do each other by
idle conversation.  Julia might have
encouraged Lucy in feeling kindly towards her
expected sister, and have made her look forward
to the meeting with pleasure; but she filled
her mind with wicked, envious thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Do my young friends ever think whether
they have roused wrong feelings in their
companions?  Two children can hardly talk
together for half an hour without having some
influence over each other, for good or for evil.
The wrong thought that you have planted in
the heart of a child may strengthen, and lead
her to do some very wicked thing when you
have forgotten the conversation.
</p>

<p>
A traveller once took some seeds of a very
valuable plant with him on a journey.  From
time to time he cast them in the fields as he
passed, and when he was far away they sprang
up and were a great blessing to the people who
owned the fields.  A wicked traveller might
have scattered the seeds of poisonous plants,
which would have grown up to bring sickness
and death to all who partook of them.  Our
life is like a journey, and whenever we talk
with the people around us, we cast some seeds
in their hearts, those which may spring up to
bless them, or those which may cause them sin
and sorrow.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
THE ARRIVAL.
</h3>

<p>
"Your sister is to be here at ten o'clock,
and you must be ready to receive her," said
Mrs. Maxwell to Lucy, a few days after the
occurrences related in the last chapter.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I put on my white frock?" asked
Lucy.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense! child," was the reply; "isn't
your sister to see you every day, from morning
to night, in whatever you happen to have on?
Go, get a clean apron, and make your hair
smooth, that is all the dressing that little girls
need."
</p>

<p>
This idea did not suit Lucy, for she was very
anxious that her sister should love her, and she
thought if she were prettily dressed at first, she
would be more likely to do so.  As she looked
in the glass while arranging her hair, she
thought she never had seemed quite so ugly.
The fact was, she was beginning to have a
fretful expression, which was spoiling her face.
Lucy had never heard that scowls must in time
become wrinkles.  She was not at all pleased
with her simple appearance, but there seemed
no way for her to wear any ornament, not even
a hair ribbon, for her soft light curls were cut
so closely, that they could only lie like her
waxen doll's, in golden rings about her head.
</p>

<p>
Lucy was fond of dress, and she would have
liked to wear jewellery to school, as many of
the scholars did, but Mrs. Maxwell never
allowed it.  The little girl had a bracelet of
her mother's hair, and this she, one morning,
clasped on her arm under her apron, to be
worn on the outside after she reached school,
where Mrs. Maxwell could not see it.  As she
stopped on the road to change it, there came a
sudden pang into her heart&mdash;she was deceiving,
and with the gift of her dead mother; perhaps
that dear mother could see her now, she
thought; and hastily putting down her sleeve,
she hurried to school.
</p>

<p>
Though the bracelet was not displayed, and
no one around her knew that she wore it, she
felt guilty and unhappy until it was restored to
the box in which it was usually kept.  The
remembrance of that day checked her this
morning, as she was about to place on her
slender finger a ring which had been her
mother's, and in her child-like dress, she went
down to wait for her sister.
</p>

<p>
She found Harty at the front window, but
by no means in a fit condition to give Rosa a
welcome, for his face had not been washed
since breakfast, and his dark curls were, as
usual, in wild confusion.
</p>

<p>
"Here comes Miss Prim!" he shouted, as
Lucy entered, "as neat as a new pin.  For my
part, I don't intend to dress up for Rosa; she'll
have to see me this way, and she may as well
get used to it at once.  I do wish she'd come, I
am tired of waiting; the clock struck ten five
minutes ago.  Hurrah! there's the carriage!"
he cried, and was out of the room in an instant.
</p>

<p>
Lucy longed to follow, but she seemed
fastened to her chair; there she sat, looking
anxiously out of the window, as the carriage
entered the yard and drove up to the door.
</p>

<p>
Her father got out first, and then gave his
hand to a tall, slender girl, who sprang with
one leap to the stops, and was locked in Harty's
rough embrace.
</p>

<p>
"But where is little Lucy?" she asked, when
Harty had ceased to smother her with kisses.
</p>

<p>
The voice was kind and cheerful, and Lucy
stepped forward, hanging her head, and timidly
putting out her hand.
</p>

<p>
Rosa overlooked the little hand, and clasped
the bashful child tenderly in her arms.
</p>

<p>
Tears came in Lucy's eyes, she could not tell
why&mdash;not because she was unhappy, for she
felt sure she should love her sister.
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, my children!" said
Dr. Vale, "may you be happy together.  Rosa,
you must be a second mother to our little one.
Lucy, show your sister her room; I must leave
you now; I must not neglect my patients, even
to enjoy seeing my children once more together."  So
saying, he drove from the door.
</p>

<p>
Rosa's room had no gloomy associations to
her, for she had not been at home at the time
of her mother's death, and she only remembered
it as the spot where she had enjoyed
much sweet conversation with that dear mother,
now, she trusted, a saint in heaven.
</p>

<p>
As her eyes fell on the truthful picture of
that lost friend, they were dimmed by natural
tears, which were soon wiped away, for why
should she weep for one whose pure spirit was
at rest?
</p>

<p>
Rosa was a Christian; not that she never did
wrong, but it was her chief wish to do right.  She
had just been confirmed, and felt most anxious
to do something to serve the Saviour, whose
follower she had professed herself to be.  When
she received her father's letter recalling her
home, she found it hard to obey, for she
had been so long at her uncle's, that it was a
severe trial to leave his family circle, and to
lose his advice, which she knew she should so
much need, to keep her true to the promises
which she had now taken upon herself.
Mr. Gillette, with gentle firmness, pointed out to
his niece that it was her plain duty to return
unhesitatingly to her father's house.
</p>

<p>
"You wish, dear Rosa," he said, "to be a
true follower of the Saviour, and to do
something for His cause.  Go home to your brother
and sister, strive by example and kind advice
to lead their young hearts to Him who will
repay all their love.  But be careful, my child,
while you are striving for the good of others,
not to neglect your own character.  Be yourself
all that you wish to make them!"
</p>

<p>
Rosa had returned with a true desire to be of
service to Lucy and Harty, and she had many
plans for their welfare.  Just now she longed to be
alone for a few moments, that she might thank
her Heavenly Father for His protecting care
during the journey, and ask His blessing on
her new home.
</p>

<p>
Her first impulse was to send the children
away, but she checked it, and made them quite
happy by allowing them to assist her in
unpacking.  Lucy handled everything very carefully,
but Harty made Rosa tremble, by his way of
tumbling over her collars and ribbons.
</p>

<p>
At last, all was unpacked but the little box
of books, which Harty insisted on opening
himself.  "Run, get my hatchet," he said to Lucy,
who willingly brought it.
</p>

<p>
"This is too small to work with," said the
eager boy, after a few moments' exertion, "get
me the large hatchet, Lucy."
</p>

<p>
Lucy again obeyed; but her brother spoke
not a word of thanks when she came back,
breathless with running.  This rudeness did
not escape Rosa, although she hoped it was
only occasioned by her brother's anxiety to
oblige her, and was not his usual manner.
</p>

<p>
The obstinate nails at last came out, and all
the party sat down on the floor, and began
taking out the books.  Harty looked at the
titles one after the other, and threw them aside
with disappointment; at length he said,
impatiently, "Are they all as sober as sermons?
I should think you were going to be a parson,
Rosa."
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly!" said she, with a merry
laugh, "but you must not be surprised if I
preach a little sometimes.  Then you don't
like my books; I am sorry for that, but I hope
we shall have a great deal of pleasure in reading
them together, by-and-by."
</p>

<p>
"Not I," answered Harty; "I like stories
about shipwrecks and great soldiers, and strange
and wonderful things."
</p>

<p>
"Then here is a book which ought to please
you," said Rosa, laying her hands on the
beautiful Bible which had been Mr. Gillette's
parting gift.  "Do you not love to read it?"
</p>

<p>
Harty hung his head, and answered, "There
are no nice stories in the Bible."
</p>

<p>
"No nice stories in the Bible!" said Rosa.
She turned the leaves rapidly, and began to
read the story of Gideon.  At first, Harty
looked very indifferent; but she read in a clear
voice, and animated manner, and by degrees
he dropped the books which lay on his lap, and
leaned his head on his hands, in rapt attention.
When she came to the attack on the camp of
the Midianites, he was ready to join the shout,
"The sword of the Lord and of Gideon!"
</p>

<p>
"Where is it? where is it?" asked Harty,
when Rosa had finished, "I want to look at it
myself."
</p>

<p>
She pointed to the place, and promised to
find him many more interesting stories, that
they could read together.
</p>

<p>
Lucy meanwhile had crept close to Rosa's
side, and laid her hand upon her lap.  "And
there is something to interest you, too, Lucy,"
said Rosa: "here is the Prodigal Son, let me
read it to you."
</p>

<p>
"Do! do! sister Rosa," said both of the
children.  She needed no urging, and read the
short and beautiful parable with real feeling.
</p>

<p>
Harty felt touched, he knew not why, but
with an effort to look unconcerned, he asked,
abruptly, "What does it mean, Rosa?"
</p>

<p>
"It teaches us many sweet lessons, dear
Harty," answered Rosa; "I cannot well
explain them all to you, but I know that it is to
make us understand that God loves us as the
father loved his wandering son.  Did you notice
that he knew the Prodigal when he was afar off,
and ran to meet him?  So God sees when we
wish to do right, though nobody about us may
guess it, and He is ready to welcome us to His
love.  Is it not strange that the Holy God
should love us so tenderly?"
</p>

<p>
Harty looked wearied, and did not reply.
Lucy tried to speak, but she was almost
weeping, and her lips would not move.
</p>

<p>
"Come, we must not talk any more," said
Rosa, cheerfully.  "See how the things are all
lying about.  Harty, can you take the box away
for me?"
</p>

<p>
He started off, with a sense of relief, and
Rosa was left alone with her little sister.  She
kissed the child gently, and said, "You must
tell me, some time, why those tears come so
quickly; I want to know all that troubles you,
and be your friend."
</p>

<p>
Lucy only replied by placing her hand in
that of her sister.  Harty now returned, and
they all went to work busily, and soon
arranged the books on the shelves of the bookcase.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Rosa," said Harty, "I want to show
you my room, and to take you down in the
orchard;" and he seized her rather forcibly by
the hand.
</p>

<p>
The room was still in confusion, and Rosa
would have preferred to stay and see her things
nicely put away, but she contented herself with
closing one or two of the drawers, and then
followed her eager brother.  Lucy silently
went with them, keeping close to her sister's
side, now and then looking half-lovingly,
half-wistfully, into Rosa's cheerful face.
</p>

<p>
Harty's room was a curiosity shop, filled with
all kinds of odd things that he had gathered
together.  Mrs. Maxwell and he had been for
a long time at war about the birds' nests, nuts,
shells, stones, &amp;c., that he was constantly
bringing to the house, and leaving about to
her great annoyance.  On several occasions
she threw away his carefully collected treasures,
and at last, the young gentleman, in great
displeasure, went to his father and asked, "if he
might not be allowed, at least in his own room,
to keep anything valuable that he found in his
walks."  His father consented, and after that
his room became a perfect museum.  Stuffed
birds, squirrel-skins, and crooked sticks were
ranged on his mantel-piece, in a kind of order,
and the chest of drawers was covered with
similar specimens.
</p>

<p>
From time to time, Mrs. Maxwell came
herself to dust among them, though Harty was
sure to complain after such visits that his
treasures had been greatly injured.  On this
particular morning Mrs. Maxwell had been
thoroughly dusting, on account of the expected
arrival, and as Harty entered the room he
darted from Rosa, and carefully taking from
the shelf some twigs, with bits of spiders' web
attached to thorn, he angrily exclaimed, "Old
Maxwell has been here, I know!  I wish she
would let my things alone! the hateful thing!
See here, Rosa, this was a beautiful web, as
perfect as it could be; I brought it only
yesterday morning, when it was all strung with
dew-drops, and now look at it!  Isn't it enough
to make any one angry?"
</p>

<p>
Rosa looked sorrowfully at her brother, and
made no reply for a moment; at length she
answered: "Dear Harty, you can find another
spider's web; but angry words once spoken can
never be taken back.  Won't you show me what
you have here, and forget your trouble?"
</p>

<p>
The hasty boy was soon engaged in explaining
what all the queer-looking things were, and
why he valued them.  In some of them Rosa
was much interested: she had never seen a
titmouse's nest before, and as she took the
curious home in her hand, she thought of the
kind Heavenly Father who had taught those
little creatures to build it with such skill, and
had watched the nestlings from the time they
left the shell, until they flew lightly away on
their fluttering wings.
</p>

<p>
"What can you be thinking about?" said
Harty, as she looked earnestly at the pretty thing.
</p>

<p>
"Pleasant thoughts," said Rosa, smiling, as
she took from his hand a huge beetle.
</p>

<p>
Lucy wondered to see her sister take what
seemed to her such a frightful thing so calmly
in her hand.  "There now!  I like that!"
shouted Harty, "she handles it like a boy.
There's Lucy, she screams if I put such a thing
near her, if it has been dead a month.  Isn't
she a goose?"
</p>

<p>
Lucy looked anxiously at Rosa, fearing she
would say something unkind.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! yes, she is a little goose," was the
reply, "but such a dear little goose, that I am
sure I shall love her very much.  We must
teach her not to be afraid of trifles."
</p>

<p>
The timid child clasped Rosa's hand more
closely, and inwardly resolved to try to please
her sister in everything.  She even touched
with the tip of her finger a snake-skin from
which she had always shrunk before, as she
heard Harty and Rosa admiring it, while they
handled it freely.
</p>

<p>
Some of the specimens which Harty seemed
to think very precious were uninteresting to
Rosa, and some were even disgusting; but she
looked at all, and tried to discover the beauties
which Harty so eagerly pointed out.
</p>

<p>
Her uncle had taught her that politeness is
a Christian duty, and to be always shown, even
to nearest relatives, and to those younger than
ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Harty was delighted, and slapped Rosa on
the back in token of his pleasure.  "You are a
glorious girl!" said Harty; "why, if that had
been Lucy, she would have cried, and said I
always hurt her."
</p>

<p>
"You forget," said Rosa, "that Lucy is a
delicate little girl; you cannot play with her as
you would with a boy.  You must take care of
her, as the knights of old guarded their
ladye-love, and handle her as carefully as you would
a bird's nest."
</p>

<p>
At this Harty laughed, and Lucy smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Now for the orchard," cried Harty; and
away he ran, pulling the girls so rapidly along
that they could hardly keep from falling down
stairs.
</p>

<p>
A pleasant place was that orchard; the grass
was fresh and short, and some of the branches
of the old trees bent almost to the ground.
Under these Harty had placed wooden seats,
and there it was his delight to study.  Very
little studying he accomplished, though, for his
eye wandered at one moment to a ripe apple
on the topmost bough, and the next to a
curious insect that was creeping on the trunk
near him.
</p>

<p>
Rosa placed herself on the rustic seat, and
looked upward through the waving branches to
the clear blue sky above, and a half smile came
over her face, that Harty did not understand.
He did not guess that the sweet scene was filling
the heart of his sister with love to the great
Creator.  Nor did Lucy understand her any
better; but the expression on her sister's
countenance made her warm with love towards her.
</p>

<p>
Harty soon grew restless, and engaged his
companions for a race.  Away they flew over
the soft grass, and Rosa was the first to reach
the fence, which had been agreed upon as the
goal; Lucy came next, while Harty, puffing
and panting, brought up the rear.
</p>

<p>
"I declare that was not fair," he began; "we
did not start together."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said Rosa; "we girls ought
to be the fastest runners, for that is all we can
do in danger.  Girls run, while boys must stand
and defend themselves and their sisters."
</p>

<p>
This view of the case suited Harty, and
reconciled him to his defeat; and they
continued chatting amicably in the orchard and
piazza until the bell rang for them to prepare
for dinner.  As they entered the house,
Mrs. Maxwell met them, and looking sternly at Rosa,
she said, "I hoped you were going to set a
good example, Miss Rosa, to these careless
children, but there I found your room all in
confusion, while you were out running races.  Your
father has reckoned without his host, if he
looks to you to make them particular."
</p>

<p>
Rosa knew that it had cost her an effort to
leave the room in that condition, and that she
had done so to please her brother.  She did not
defend herself, however, for she now saw that
it would have been better to make him wait a
few moments.  Hastening up stairs, she soon
found a place for everything, and put everything
in its place, and as she did so, she resolved
not to let her anxiety to win the affection
of her brother and sister lead her astray.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Vale looked very happy, when he sat
down to dinner with his family about him.  He
was pleased with Rosa's easy, cheerful manner,
and delighted to see Lucy's face lighted with
smiles, and Harty doing his best to act the
gentleman.  And acting it was, for anything
like politeness was far from being habitual with
him.
</p>

<p>
When they rose from the table, Dr. Vale led
his eldest daughter to her room, and entering
it, closed the door.  The doctor walked towards
the portrait, and gazed at it a few moments in
silence, then, turning to Rosa, he said, with
some emotion, "You do not, I fear, remember
your mother distinctly, my child.  I have had
this life-like image of your mother placed
where it will be ever near you, that it may
remind you of the part that you must act to the
dear children.  May God bless and assist you
in your task: pray earnestly to Him to watch
over you and guide you, and you cannot fail.
And now, dearest, never think me cold nor
stern, when I am silent.  My professional
cares often weigh so heavily upon me that I
notice but little what is passing around me;
but nothing can so absorb my mind as to make
me indifferent to the welfare of my children.
Come to me with all that troubles you, and you
shall find a father's heart, though perhaps a
faltering tongue."
</p>

<p>
The doctor pressed his daughter to his bosom,
kissed her forehead, and left the room.  As
soon as he had gone, Rosa fell on her knees to
implore the God of all good to strengthen her
for the great task that was before her, and to
enable her to make herself such an example as
the children might safely follow.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
AN ACCIDENT.
</h3>

<p>
In about half an hour there was a gentle
tap at Rosa's door.  It was Lucy, who
entered timidly, and going towards Rosa, said,
blushing, "Don't mind Mrs. Maxwell, dear;
she often speaks in that way to me, when she
don't mean anything."
</p>

<p>
"Mind her!  No and yes: she will not
worry me; but I shall be glad to have some
one to make me remember to be neat at all
times.  Where's Harty?" said Rosa.
</p>

<p>
"He's getting ready to go to the woods: he
wants you to go with him."
</p>

<p>
"With all my heart," answered Rosa.  "Are
we to go now?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, as soon as we can put on our bonnets,"
said Lucy, as she went to her room, to get her
things.  She put on a pair of thin slippers,
although she knew they were to cross a damp
meadow, for she could not make up her mind
to wear the thick boots that were so much more
suitable.  Lucy had certain articles of dress
which it gave her great pleasure to wear,
and these shoes were among the favourites.
Many a cold and sore-throat they had cost
her, but her vanity was not overcome even
by such consequences.
</p>

<p>
Hand in hand the three children walked
merrily along, chatting as pleasantly as if
they had not been parted for years.
</p>

<p>
Rosa and Harty declared that they liked
to step on the soft meadow, that it was like
a rich carpet that yielded to their feet.  Their
shoes were so thick that they did not feel the
dampness, and they had no idea how
uncomfortable Lucy was, in her thin slippers,
thoroughly soaked with the moisture.  They
soon entered the woods, where the tall trees
grew so close together that they almost shut
out the pleasant sunlight.  Here Rosa found
so much to admire that she was constantly
exclaiming with delight.  She had not lived in
the country since her childhood, and there was
a charm in everything that met her eyes.
Sometimes she was struck with new beauties,
and sometimes she was reminded of by-gone days.
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember, Harty," she said, "how
we came here together, when you were a little
bit of a boy, and made a house under that tree
for my doll to lie in?  And have you forgotten,
when we where gathering chestnuts just here,
and I found I had lost my shawl, and how we
hunted, and found it at last hanging on the
fence by the meadow?"
</p>

<p>
Harty remembered these and many other
occasions when he had enjoyed rambles with
his sister; and they continued calling the past
to mind, until poor Lucy felt quite sad that she
knew nothing of what caused them so much
pleasure.  She grew silent, and at last
withdrew her hand from Rosa, as she thought,
"Yes, it will be as Julia Staples said, Harty
and Rosa will go together, and not care for me."
</p>

<p>
The sun was just setting when they drew
near home on their return.  They had taken a
long walk, but Lucy had not recovered her
spirits, although Rosa, perceiving that she was
not happy, had done all in her power to amuse
her.  Lucy felt half inclined to laugh and enjoy
herself occasionally, but then the wicked,
jealous thought would come up in her mind,
and she grew sober again, and coldly answered
her sister's cheerful remarks.
</p>

<p>
They had walked through the woods quite
round to the back of the house, and were
almost to the pleasant orchard, when they came
to a wide brook, which they must cross to reach
the by-path that led to the house.  A single
plank was placed across the stream.  Harty
ran gaily over, and went up the hill on the
other side without looking behind him.
</p>

<p>
"Let me lead you over," said Rosa, kindly
offering her hand to her little sister.
</p>

<p>
"I had rather go by myself," answered Lucy,
sullenly, and placed her foot on the plank.  She
walked tremblingly on until she was half over,
then the plank shook a little, and she grew
frightened, swayed from side to side, lost her
balance, and fell into the brook.
</p>

<p>
Lucy's shriek attracted the attention of
Harty, who was by this time some distance up
the hill, and he hastened towards her; but she
had scarcely sunk in the water before Rosa had
leaped from the bank and caught her in her
arms.
</p>

<p>
The stream was rapid, and the fearless girl
could hardly have kept her footing had she not
caught hold of the plank above with one hand,
while with the other she carried the
half-fainting Lucy.
</p>

<p>
They reached the opposite side in safety, and
Harty was there to assist them in climbing the
bank.  Great tears stood in his eyes, not from
fright for Lucy, but from admiration of Rosa's
courage.
</p>

<p>
"You are a sister worth having!" were his
first words.  "How I wish you were a boy!"
</p>

<p>
Poor Lucy, what pain these words gave her!
Although she had been in such danger, Harty
only thought of Rosa!
</p>

<p>
The true-hearted sister, meanwhile, was
lifting her thoughts in thankfulness to Him who
had enabled her to save the life of the child.
</p>

<p>
Lucy was too weak to walk home, and Rosa
and Harty formed a lady-chair with their arms,
and carried her safely up the hill, Rosa laughing
at their ridiculous appearance in their wet
clothing, for she had plunged into the stream
up to her neck.
</p>

<p>
"Here we are! all safe and sound!" shouted
Harty, as Mrs. Maxwell came out to meet the
strange-looking party.
</p>

<p>
"A pretty-looking set you are!  Do not
come into the house in that condition!" was
Mrs. Maxwell's reply.  "Pray where have you
been?" she continued: "I wonder if we are
to have such doings all the time."
</p>

<p>
Rosa gently but firmly replied, that Lucy
had been in great danger, and she thought she
ought to be undressed immediately, and placed
in a warm bed.
</p>

<p>
There was something in Rosa's quiet,
dignified manner that awed Mrs. Maxwell:
she came forward and took Lucy from their
arms without another word, while Rosa
hastened to her room to put herself in order
to wait upon her sister.  In a few moments
she was neatly dressed, and standing by Lucy's
bedside.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Vale had returned, and having heard
from Harty an account of the matter, was
soon with his little daughter.  He ordered a
warm draught to be administered, and said he
did not think she needed any other medicine,
as she seemed not to be really injured, only
much agitated by the fright.
</p>

<p>
He kissed the little girl tenderly as he
thought how near he had been to losing his
pet, and greatly praised Rosa's promptness
and courage in saving her from the death with
which she was threatened.
</p>

<p>
Lucy could not thank her sister, for she
felt guilty, as she remembered the unkind,
suspicious thoughts that were in her mind
when the accident happened.  She shuddered
at the idea that she might have died while
her spirit was so unfit to go into the presence
of the holy God.  She felt that she had been
very wicked, and she could not believe that
God would pardon her.
</p>

<p>
"I know I shall be very ill," she said to
herself, "because I was so naughty, and
perhaps I shall die, and then nobody would
care, and Harty and Rosa would be just as
happy."
</p>

<p>
This last thought checked her half-formed
resolution to tell her sister of her wrong
feelings; and she turned away from the kind
face that was bending down to her, and said,
"I wish you would go away, I had rather be alone."
</p>

<p>
Rosa did go, but only to the door of her own
room that was opposite: there she placed her
chair, that she might be near, if Lucy should
be lonely or want anything, little thinking
what was in her sister's heart.
</p>

<p>
Lucy lay very still all the evening.  Rosa
thought she was sleeping, and did not disturb
her.  During those long, dark hours, Rosa was
not sad.  She had many pleasant thoughts.
She liked to be alone, sometimes, for then
she could more fully realize that God was with
her.
</p>

<p>
Nine o'clock came, yet Rosa did not like to
leave her sister: often during the evening she
had stolen to her side to see if she were still
sleeping.  Once she stooped and kissed her;
then Lucy longed to throw her arms around
the neck of the kind watcher, and say that she
had not been asleep; but something kept her
silent.
</p>

<p>
At ten, the doctor came in.  Rosa stole
softly down stairs and told him how quiet the
little girl had been during the evening.
"But, dear father," she said, "I do not like
to leave her alone to-night.  May I not lay her
in my bed, where I shall be sure to know if
she wakes, and wants anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, dear," was the father's reply,
"and I will carry her myself, carefully, that
she may not wake.  She is too heavy for you
to lift, though you did take her so nobly
through the water, my darling."
</p>

<p>
The doctor took the little girl gently in his
arms; she did not seem to be awake, but oh! how
guilty she felt all the time, to think that
she had cherished harsh feelings towards one
who wished to be so kind to her; and
ashamed she felt that she was even then
deceiving; but she had not the courage to
open her eyes and say that it was all pretence.
Rosa covered her very carefully, and placed
her head comfortably on the pillow, and then
began to move about noiselessly, preparing for
the night.
</p>

<p>
Lucy was just closing her eyes, thinking her
bed-fellow was about to lie down beside her,
when Rosa threw her wrapper round her, and
taking her small Bible, sat down to read.  She
did not once raise her eyes or move, while she
was reading, yet Lucy could see that her
expression changed from time to time, as if she
was very much interested.  There was a sweet
peacefulness on her countenance as she closed
the book, and Lucy resolved to open at the
mark the next morning, that she might read
herself what had had so pleasant an effect.
</p>

<p>
She then looked up and saw that Rosa was
kneeling, with her eyes raised, and praying
earnestly in a low voice.  Lucy was almost
startled, Rosa seemed so really to be speaking
to some one, and she involuntarily looked
about to see if there were any one in the room.
</p>

<p>
She had been so long accustomed to merely
prayers herself, that she had almost
forgotten that prayer is always speaking to
God.
</p>

<p>
By degrees she rose in the bed and leaned
eagerly forward to catch the words, which were
scarcely audible as she lay on the pillow.
</p>

<p>
She heard her sister earnestly ask pardon for
the sins she had just been confessing, while
she thanked her Heavenly Father with the
confidence of a child for His free forgiveness;
and then she prayed, oh, how earnestly! that
God would enable her to watch over her
brother and sister, and lead them to the dear
Saviour, the only source of real happiness,
and for whose sake she knew all her petitions
would be granted.  Before she rose, she
begged to be enabled to remember that the
Saviour was beside her, through the dark
night to preserve her from all harm.
</p>

<p>
As Rosa finished her prayer, Lucy sank
down in the bed, overcome with awe.  God
was really in the room; Rosa had spoken to
Him, and seemed to know that He had heard
her.  What must His pure eye have seen in
her own heart! how much that was wrong!
Could He forgive?  In a few moments the
light was extinguished, and Rosa was at her
sister's side.  She lay very still at first, that
she might not waken the sleeper, but very soon
a little hand was laid in hers, and Lucy gently
whispered, "Dear Rosa, do you really think
the Saviour is near us?"
</p>

<p>
Rosa was startled to find her companion
awake; but she took the little hand instantly,
and said, "Yes, dear Lucy, He is with us
always."
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't it make you afraid," said Lucy,
"to think so?"
</p>

<p>
"Afraid to think He is near us, dearest!
Why, He is our best friend!  Do not you love
Him, Lucy?"
</p>

<p>
Lucy began to sob, and said, at last, that it
always frightened her to think about such
things, and she never did, unless something
reminded her that she must die.
</p>

<p>
"My dear little sister," said Rosa, "God
loves you: you need not be afraid of Him,
if you really wish to please Him."
</p>

<p>
"But I can't please Him, I can't do right,"
sobbed Lucy.
</p>

<p>
"I know you cannot," Rosa replied, "but
He will forgive you for Jesus' sake, and help
you, if you ask Him."
</p>

<p>
"But I forget all about it," said Lucy.
</p>

<p>
"It is very hard to remember at first, that
God is always with you, and you are trying to
be His child.  I know, dear Lucy, that you
must wish to love and serve the kind Heavenly
Father who has done so much for you: begin
to-night; ask Him to make you His child, and
to take care of you."
</p>

<p>
Lucy made no answer, but in silence she did
as her sister had advised, and God who seeth
all hearts received and answered her simple
petition.
</p>

<p>
The few words that Rosa had said, dwelt
in her mind.  "God loves you," she thought,
again and again, as she lay in her quiet bed;
and when her eyes closed in sleep, it was with
the remembrance that the God who loved her
was near to watch over her.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
SUNDAY MORNING.
</h3>

<p>
Sunday morning came, and the sun was
fairly risen before either of the little girls was
awake.  Rosa was the first to open her eyes:
she would willingly have taken another nap,
but the first stanza of a morning hymn occurred
to her mind, and she remembered her resolution
to overcome her laziness.
</p>

<p>
As she repeated&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Awake, my soul, and with the sun<br />
  Thy daily course of duty run,<br />
  Shake off dull sloth, and early rise<br />
  To pay thy morning sacrifice,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
she got up very carefully that she might not
rouse her sister.  "I will let the child sleep a
little longer," she said to herself, "for she is
so pale, I don't believe she is quite well."
</p>

<p>
It was a beautiful morning: the fields and
orchards were bright with the sunshine, and
the birds seemed singing even more happily
than usual.  As soon as Rosa had dressed herself,
and finished her usual devotions, she went
down stairs to enjoy the fresh air.  As she
walked in the garden, the conversation she
had had with Lucy the evening before passed
through her mind.  What her uncle had said
to her about being useful to her own family
seemed about to be realized.  "Poor little
Lucy," she thought: "may God help me to
lead the dear child in the right path."
</p>

<p>
Harty heard Rosa's footsteps in the garden,
and was soon at her side.  "Here, brother, is
something for your museum," was her greeting,
and she pointed to a chrysalis which hung on a
low rose-twig by the path.  "Is it not beautiful?
Just look at the silver spots!"
</p>

<p>
"It is a capital specimen," answered Harty,
as he carefully broke the little branch to which
it was fastened: "I wonder what kind of a
butterfly it will be.  Rosa!" he added, "I
did not think you would like such things as
these."
</p>

<p>
"Not like the beautiful things God has
made!" exclaimed Rosa.  "Why, I love to
look at every little object in nature, and think
that our Heavenly Father planned it and made
it so perfect.  It seems easy to believe that He
notices all our little joys and troubles, when wo
see that even the smallest insect is made with
such care."
</p>

<p>
As Rosa spoke, her eyes sparkled and she
looked around her, as if every object which was
in sight was a proof to her of the love of the
kind Creator.  Harty made no answer, but
looked thoughtfully at the chrysalis as they
entered the house together.
</p>

<p>
The breakfast-bell was ringing, and they met
Lucy in the hall.  She glanced slyly towards
her sister, remembering the conversation of the
evening before.  Rosa kissed her cordially,
and, hand in hand, they went to the table.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps Miss Rosa had bettor pour out
coffee," said Mrs. Maxwell stiffly to the doctor,
as the children came in.
</p>

<p>
"Would you like it, Rosa?" asked her father.
</p>

<p>
Rosa saw that Mrs. Maxwell looked displeased,
and, in a moment, it passed through
her mind, that perhaps she would not like to
give up the place she had held so long to one
so young as herself, and she quickly said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"May I put that off a little longer, father?
I am afraid I could not suit you as well as
Mrs. Maxwell does; she has made tea for you
a great while."
</p>

<p>
"A long time, dear child," said the doctor;
and his thoughts went back to the days when
his delicate wife sat opposite him, her sweet
face growing paler each morning, until at last
her weak hands could no longer do their office,
and Mrs. Maxwell took her place.
</p>

<p>
Rosa knew of what her father must be thinking,
and she did not speak for several minutes.
At length she said, "Is old Mr. Packard any
better to-day, father?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not seen him yet," was the reply.
"I shall have to make a round of visits this
morning," continued the doctor, "so I shall
not have the pleasure of taking my tall
daughter to church to-day: I leave that to
Harty."
</p>

<p>
Harty looked very proud at the idea of
waiting on his sister.  Little Lucy listened in
vain to hear something said about her forming
one of the party.  She resolved, at least, to get
ready, and perhaps no one would object to her
going.
</p>

<p>
When they rose from the breakfast-table,
Rosa went to her room, thinking she should
have a quiet hour to herself before it was time
to prepare for church; but Lucy and Harty
followed her.  The rules had been very strict
at Mr. Gillette's: the young ladies seldom,
visited each other in their bed-rooms, and then
never entered without knocking.
</p>

<p>
The freedom with which her sister went in
and out of her apartment was already an
annoyance to Rosa, and her first impulse was
to send them away, that she might read her
Bible alone, as she had intended.  Then her
confirmation vow came to her remembrance.
She had promised "to love her neighbour as
herself, to do unto others as she would they
should do unto her."  Would she like to be
sent away from a person she loved? and was it
not a part of her duty to make those around her
happy?  Her first impulse was conquered, and
she turned cheerfully to the children, who felt
uncomfortable for a moment, they hardly knew
why, and said, "Come, let us sit here by the
window; I am going to read, and you shall
listen to me, if you please."
</p>

<p>
They looked delighted.  Lucy dropped upon
a low footstool by her sister's side, and Harty
stood watching eagerly to see what was to be
the chosen book.  He seemed disappointed when
Rosa took up her little Bible, and shook his
head when she asked him if he would not take
the vacant chair beside her.
</p>

<p>
She began to read in the fifth chapter of
Mark, "And, behold, there cometh one of the
rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and
when he saw Him [Jesus], he fell at His feet,
and besought Him greatly, saying, My little
daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray
thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she
may be healed; and she shall live."
</p>

<p>
Rosa had taken great pains to learn to read
properly and pleasantly, for her uncle had told
her that to be an agreeable reader was one way
of being useful.  Now her voice was sweet and
natural, and she seemed herself so interested,
that Lucy caught her spirit even before the
"little daughter" was mentioned; but at these
words her attention was fixed, and she listened
eagerly to hear what was to follow.
</p>

<p>
Harty, meanwhile, stood rolling the corner
of the neat white curtain in his hands, which
were not particularly clean, and looking
undecidedly about him.  When Rosa finished the
sentence, he hurried from the room, saying,
"I'm going to see my chickens."
</p>

<p>
She glanced at the soiled curtain and then at
Harty as he closed the door: for a moment she
looked fretted, but it was only a moment; a
sweet smile took the place of the half-formed
frown, and she went on with the reading.
</p>

<p>
Lucy had heard the story before of the
raising of the ruler's daughter, but now it
seemed quite new to her, and her eyes were
bright with wonder and pleasure, as her sister
closed the book.
</p>

<p>
"Rosa," she said, "I should like to have
been that little girl!"
</p>

<p>
"Why?" said Rosa,
</p>

<p>
"Because&mdash;because," answered Lucy&mdash;"because
she must have been so glad to be alive
again.  I wonder what she said when they told
her all that had happened."
</p>

<p>
"I hope she thanked the land Saviour, and
learned to love Him very dearly."
</p>

<p>
"How sorry she must have been that the
Saviour could not stay and live at her home,
and take care of her always," said Lucy.
</p>

<p>
"Lucy," said Rosa, "the same thing may
happen to you as to that little girl; but after
Christ has said to you, Arise, you may live
with Him always."
</p>

<p>
Lucy looked half-frightened, and answered,
"I don't understand you.  I should have to
die first;" and she shuddered at the thought.
</p>

<p>
"No; you may have Christ with you always,
without dying, but you cannot see Him.  He
will take care of you, and you can speak to
Him, and He will do what you ask Him.  If
you remember that He loves you and is ever
at your side, when you come to die it will seem
like opening your eyes to see the kind Friend
who has been so long with you."
</p>

<p>
Lucy's eyes filled with tears, and in her
heart she wished that she loved the Saviour as
Rosa did.  "I will try and remember that He
is with me," she said to herself; and for the
first time the idea was pleasant to her.  Before
she had only thought of God as seeing her
when she was doing wrong, and it had always
been a very painful thought to her.
</p>

<p>
Many minutes had passed when Lucy started
up, saying, "There goes the church bell; it is
time to get ready."
</p>

<p>
Rosa and Lucy were quite ready, when
Harty came running into the room, his hair in
its usual tumbled state, and his coat dusty and
torn.  "Oh!  I have had such a chase," he
said: "one of my 'bantys' got out, and I had
to jump over the fence and chase him all over
the orchard before I could catch him.  And see
here, where I tore my coat putting him back in
the coop.  Why! you are all ready: is it
church-time?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed," answered Lucy; "and I hate
to be late, people all look at you so."
</p>

<p>
"I hate to be late, too," said Harty; "I do
like to watch the people come in."
</p>

<p>
"Harty!  Harty!" interrupted Rosa; "don't
talk so.  Make haste and get ready."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind me," said Harty; "you walk
on, and I can catch up with you: it won't take
me but a minute to change my coat&mdash;these
trowsers will do."
</p>

<p>
"But, Harty, you will have to brush your
hair and your shoes, and wash yourself.  It
would not be respectful to the place where you
are going to enter in such a plight."
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!" said Harty, angrily; "I will not
go at all; you can find your way, with little
Lucy to open the door for you."
</p>

<p>
Rosa was tempted to leave him, for she, too,
disliked to be late at church, but not for either
of the reasons that had been mentioned.  She
liked to be in her seat before the service
commenced, that she might have time to
collect her thoughts, and be ready to join with
the congregation in the solemn worship of God.
</p>

<p>
"My brother ought not to stay at home,"
she thought: "it will be better to wait for
him, even if we are late."  "Come, Harty,"
said she, encouragingly, "we will help you,
and you will soon be ready."
</p>

<p>
Lucy was dispatched to the kitchen for the
shoes that had been cleaned, for Harty's cap,
pocket-hankerchief, another clean collar, &amp;c.;
in short, she had so many things to run for,
that she stopped on the landing, so weary that
she was glad to take breath.  There
Mrs. Maxwell met her, and said, "Take off those
things, Lucy Vale; you ought not to think of
going to church after the wetting you got
yesterday.  Your father didn't say you might
go; I noticed it this morning."
</p>

<p>
"But I am quite well," pleaded Lucy.  "I
think he would let me go, if he were at home."
</p>

<p>
"But he is not at home.  At noon you can
ask him.  Go now and undress as fast as you
can."  Without another word Mrs. Maxwell
passed down stairs.
</p>

<p>
Lucy dropped down upon the lowest stop,
and began to cry bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Ready at last!" shouted Harty: "now
Lucy, my Prayer Book."
</p>

<p>
But no Lucy came.  Rosa and Harty came
towards her, and wore astonished to see her
face wot with tears.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" asked Rosa: "have
you hurt yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"No!" sobbed Lucy; "but Mrs. Maxwell
says I must not go to church."
</p>

<p>
"Pooh! is that all?" said Harty; "why, you
are not always so fond of church-going!"
</p>

<p>
This was true, for Lucy often stayed away
from church when Mrs. Maxwell did not oblige
her to go; but on this particular morning she
wanted to go with her sister, whom she was
beginning to love very dearly.
</p>

<p>
"But why mustn't you go?" asked Rosa.
</p>

<p>
"Because I got in the water yesterday, and
Mrs. Maxwell says I am not well."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, dear," said Rosa, "perhaps
father will let you go out this afternoon.  Don't
cry any more; we shall not be gone long.  Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
Harty was rather glad that Lucy could not
go; he never liked to take Lucy anywhere with
him.  Perhaps he thought it made him appear
more like a mere boy to have his little sister by
his side, or that she was not fit to associate with
so wise a gentleman as himself.
</p>

<p>
If his sister Rosa had felt as ungenerously
and unkindly to those younger than herself,
she would have at least laughingly refused the
arm which he offered her as they went down
the walk.  But she took the arm, although she
had to stoop a little in doing so, and talked
with her brother as if he really were the man
he was trying to appear.
</p>

<p>
As Harty was thus honoured, he looked back
triumphantly at poor Lucy, who was still
watching them.  A pang of envy shot through
the heart of the little girl.  Julia Staples's
evil words came to her mind; the bad seed was
springing up.  "Rosa and Harty will always be
together; they won't care for me," she thought.
But good seed had been sown by Rosa, and it,
too, now sprang up.  "God loves me," thought
the little girl; "if I try to please Him I shall
be happy."
</p>

<p>
She rose and wont into her own pretty room:
there she put everything carefully in its proper
place, and felt a new pleasure in doing so; for
it was her duty.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
STAYING AT HOME.
</h3>

<p>
The house was very still, and as Lucy moved
about she was half startled at the sound of her
own footsteps.  She went into her sister's room
to sit, for she fancied that it was more pleasant
than her own; and then all Rosa's books were
there; perhaps she might like to look at some
of them.
</p>

<p>
The Bible was on the table; she took it up.
"Rosa, from her Uncle Gillette," was written
on the blank leaf; and before it were several
sentences.  They were as follows:&mdash;"Remember
when you open this book, that God is with you,
that He is speaking to you.  Remember to ask
God to bless to you what you read.  When you
close the book, think over what you have been
reading, and take the first opportunity to
practise it."
</p>

<p>
As Lucy read the first sentence, a fooling of
awe stole over her; and she almost trembled to
think how often she had carelessly opened the
word of God, and hurried over its sacred
pages.  Now she reverently turned to the place
where her sister had left the mark the evening
before.  The story of the storm on the sea of
Galilee caught her eye: as she read it she felt
sure that it must have been that sweet narrative
which had so fixed Rosa's attention when she
watched her.
</p>

<p>
Lucy repeated, again and again, the words of
the blessed Saviour, "Why are ye so fearful,
O ye of little faith?"  They seemed addressed
to her by the kind Friend who stilled the
tempest, and who, Rosa had said, would be
ever with her to take care of her, if she would
love Him and strive to be truly His child.  "I
will, I will love Him, and try to please Him,"
she said, half-aloud.  "I should never be
afraid, if I were sure He would watch over me."
</p>

<p>
She took up the Prayer Book, and read
the verses with which the Morning Service
commences.  Some of them she did not quite
understand; but when she came to "I will
arise, and go to my father, and will say unto
him, Father, I have sinned against heaven,
and before thee, and am no more worthy to be
called thy son," she was reminded of the
day when her sister had read to her the sweet
parable from which those words are taken,
and how she had said that one purpose of the
parable was to show how willing God is to
receive all those who really come to Him.
Again her purpose strengthened to be His
child, who could so freely forgive.
</p>

<p>
Lucy had been over the same Service almost
every Sunday since she had been able to read,
and could now find all the places without
assistance, but she had hardly noticed many parts
of it, and to some she had listened, while they
were repeated by others, as if she had no part
in the matter.  Now the exhortation, "Dearly
beloved brethren, the Scripture moveth us in
sundry places," seemed so direct and simple,
that she wondered she could ever have heard it
without feeling for how important a purpose
she had come into the house of God.
</p>

<p>
With a strange feeling of solemnity, she
knelt down and began to repeat the Confession
aloud.  The words were so simple and natural,
and so true, that she seemed rather to be
speaking what had long been in her heart, than
repeating what had been spoken by many voices
around her from Sunday to Sunday, while she
thoughtlessly glanced on the page, or let her
mind wander to other things.  As she said,
"We have done those things that we ought
not to have done," little faults she had
committed, acts known only to herself, came
thronging on her memory.  Among these painful
recollections was the falsehood she had told about
the light the morning after the thunder-storm.
The whole fearful scene of that night came
back to her: again she seemed standing,
trembling and alone, in the passage, while the
incessant lightning appeared to threaten her
with instant death.  So long she dwelt on these
circumstances, that she quite forgot she was on
her knees, speaking to the mighty God of
heaven.  Suddenly it flashed upon her, and
she started up, as if she feared He would
immediately punish her for seeming to be praying,
while her thoughts were far away.  Lucy
had begun to realize that prayer is something
more than merely repeating a form of
words.
</p>

<p>
The little girl had hardly risen from her
knees before there was a ring at the door.  She
set off immediately to save Betsy the trouble of
coming up stairs, for the poor old woman
suffered much from rheumatism, and Lucy
knew it gave her great pain to move about.
"I will go, Betsy," she called, as she passed
the stairway.
</p>

<p>
A ragged Irishman was standing at the door.
Lucy was almost afraid to turn the key, lest he
should lay hold of her with his hard, rough
hands: she felt inclined to call out to him to
go away, as the doctor was not at home; but
she thought of the misery that giving way to
her fear of Mrs. Tappan's dog had cost her,
and her father's reproof, and she resolved that
no poor sufferer should go uncared-for because
she was afraid to speak to a man in ragged
clothes.
</p>

<p>
She threw the door wide open, and was quite
relieved when the Irishman took off his hat,
and asked her very respectfully, "Is the
doctor in?"
</p>

<p>
"He is not," answered Lucy, promptly:
"where shall I tell him to call?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure and it's jist down the lane, forninst
Bridget O'Brady's: he can't miss it, for isn't
it the poorest bit of roof in the place? and tell
him to come quick, if you plase, miss."
</p>

<p>
The man turned to go away, but Lucy called
after him, not at all satisfied that the direction
would be sufficient.  "What is your name?"
she asked; "I want to put it down on the slate
for my father."
</p>

<p>
"It's Owen M'Grath, plase you; and don't
be afther stopping me, for who will be minding
the baby, and the mother so sick, while I am
jist talking here?"  So saying, he hurried from
the door.
</p>

<p>
Lucy had very little idea how the name was
to be spelt, but she put it down as well as she
could, the direction and all, and looked at it
quite proudly when it was done.  It was neatly
written, but oh, the spelling!
</p>

<p>
"Who was that, Miss Lucy?" called Betsy.
</p>

<p>
"An Irishman with a queer name: he says
he lives by Bridget O'Brady's," was the reply.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! dreadful!" shouted Betsy.  "Why,
Miss Lucy, they've got the small-pox in all
them dirty little houses; you've ketched it for
certain.  Go, take off every rag of clothes you've
got on, and throw them into the tub there in
the yard: I don't know who'll wash 'em.  I
am sure I should not want to touch 'em with
a broomstick."
</p>

<p>
Poor Lucy, pale and trembling, ran up stairs
and did as Betsy had advised.  Even in the
midst of her fright she could not help thinking
that she was glad it was her calico, not the
favourite silk, that she happened to have on,
since she must thrust it into the water, to lie
there till some one should dare to remove it.
</p>

<p>
The happy birds were still singing about the
pretty cottage, and the trees were waving in the
sunshine, but Lucy did not see them; her
hands were pressed tightly over her eyes, and
she rocked to and fro, thinking of all the
horrible stories she had heard about the disease
which Betsy said she had "ketched for certain."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be very ill," she thought, "and who
will dare to nurse me?  Perhaps I shall die;
and if I get well, my face will be all marked,
so that nobody will like to look at me.  I
wonder if Rosa would be afraid to sit by my
bed, if nobody else would stay with me.  I
should hate to see her face all pitted.  How
badly I should feel if she should take the
small-pox from me.  Perhaps I shall give it to her if
I see her now."  At this last thought, Lucy ran
into her own little room.  There she sat sobbing
until church was out.  She forgot that there
was a Friend with her, in that quiet room, who
could have given her comfort, if she had called
on Him in her trouble.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
THE KING AND HIS WEAPONS.
</h3>

<p>
Rosa and Harty were scarcely out of the
church door before he began, "Oh!  Rosa, did
you see how grand Madam Maxwell looked,
when she moved for you to take the end of the
pew?  It was as much as to say, 'I suppose,
little miss, you think you ought to sit here, but
you are very presuming.'  I would have taken
it if I had been in your place.  It made me mad
to see her settle herself so satisfied, when you
refused."
</p>

<p>
"Fie, Harty!" answered Rosa; "Mrs. Maxwell
is a great deal older than I am, and
it is far more suitable that she should have the
most comfortable seat.  I should be sorry if my
coming home interfered with her in any way.
She has been most faithful in taking charge of
the house since&mdash;since&mdash;" since our dear
mother died, Rosa would have added, but her
eyes filled and her voice failed her.  The
familiar scene in the church had brought her
lost mother freshly before her, and she well
remembered when they last trod that same
path together.
</p>

<p>
After a few moments she recovered herself,
and said, "When I last passed this spot,
Harty, our dear mother was with me.  She
had been talking very sweetly to me, as we
walked, of the blessing we had in being able to
go out that pleasant morning, and worship God
with His people, while so many poor invalids
must remain at home, and even dear father
could not be with us.  Just here, I asked her
a question which had long been in my mind.
I had always noticed that as soon as she entered
the pew, she knelt down for a few minutes.  I
wondered what that was for, as I could not
find anything about it in the Prayer Book.
'Mother,' said I, 'what do you say when you
kneel down before church begins?'  'I make a
short prayer,' she answered, 'that I may
remember that I am in God's house, and that He
will teach me to worship Him aright.  Many
people,' she continued, 'who come early to
church, quite forget that they are in the house
of God as much before the service begins as
afterwards, and spend the time until the
clergyman comes in, in looking about and observing
their neighbours, until their minds are quite
unfit to join in any solemn duty.  I think the
habit of asking the blessing of God on the
prayers you are about to offer, and the truths
you are about to hear, is a great help in
reminding you immediately that you are with
the Lord in His holy temple.'  'Won't you
teach me a little prayer to say, that I may do
as you do?' I asked.  'Yes, darling,' she
answered, with one of her sweet, loving smiles;
and as we walked by this hedge, which was
just planted then, she taught me these words,
which I have said, many, many times since
our dear mother was taken by her Heavenly
Father to a better world:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Lord, make me remember that I am in
Thy house.  Keep me from dullness and
wandering thoughts.  Hear my prayers to-day,
and bless to my soul the truths I shall hear,
for Jesus Christ's sake.  Amen.'"
</p>

<p>
Harty listened with interest to every word
that Rosa tittered: he often wanted to hear
some one talk of his mother, but it was too sad
a subject for his father to speak freely upon,
and Lucy could hardly remember her.
</p>

<p>
Rosa gladly perceived that he was interested,
and added, "I will write out the little prayer
for you, Harty; I know you will like to keep
it, and use it, for our dear mother's sake."
</p>

<p>
Harty looked embarrassed, but he did not
refuse his sister's offer.  She immediately
changed the subject by saying, "Poor little
Lucy will be glad to see us by this time.  I
hope she can go out this afternoon.  I like to
have her with us."
</p>

<p>
Harty wondered that Rosa should wish for
the society of such a child as Lucy; but his
respect for her involuntarily rose when he found
that Rosa spoke affectionately of her.
</p>

<p>
As they drew near the house, they caught a
glimpse of Lucy looking sorrowfully from her
window.  She did not run to meet them, as
they expected, but old Betsy came out saying,
"Oh! only think of it!  Miss Lucy has got
the small-pox, I know she has.  There's been a
man here that must have it, for he lives down
by Bridget O'Brady's, where they are dirty
enough to make them all ill."
</p>

<p>
Rosa was startled for a moment, but she
answered calmly, "But Lucy has been vaccinated,
Betsy; she would not take the small-pox
even if the man really had it."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe nothin' at all in <i>vaxnation</i>,"
said Betsy; "it don't stand to reason.  I telled
Miss Lucy she'd ketched the small-pox, and I
believe she has."
</p>

<p>
"Poor child!" said Rosa; and she ran
hastily up stairs.  Harty did not follow, for
although he laughed at Lucy's timidity, he was
a bit of a coward about some things himself;
and old Betsy's words had alarmed him not a
little.
</p>

<p>
"Let me in, Lucy," said Rosa's sweet voice
entreatingly; "I could not take the small-pox
if you had it."
</p>

<p>
Lucy gladly unfastened the door.  Rosa
took the trembling girl in her lap.  For a few
moments Lucy sobbed violently, and not a
word was spoken; at length Rosa said,
tenderly, "Dear Lucy, there is no danger of
what you dread so much.  Here, let me look
at those little arms: there is the scar where
you wore vaccinated when you were a baby,
that you might never take the small-pox.
Your kind father took good care that his little
Lucy should not have her smooth face all
pitted."
</p>

<p>
"Can't I have it?" asked Lucy, the tears
still in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"No! certainly not!" was the reply.
</p>

<p>
"But, dearest," continued Rosa, "you may be
exposed to other diseases quite as dangerous.
I wish you could learn to trust the Heavenly
Father, who loves you more dearly even than
our own papa; then you would not be afraid of
anything.  Shall I tell you what I heard uncle
Gillette saying to one of the little girls at
school, who was afraid of lightning."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! do," said Lucy; "I am so frightened
when it thunders."
</p>

<p>
Lucy nestled closer in her sister's lap, and
Rosa began.
</p>

<p>
"There was once a mighty king who was so
terrible in war that all his enemies were afraid
of him; the very sound of his name made
them tremble.  His arm was so strong that the
horse and its rider would sink under one blow
of his battle-axe; and when he struck with
his sharp sword, his enemies fell dead at his
feet.  This mighty king had a little fair-haired
daughter, who watched him as he prepared for
the battle.  She saw him put on his helmet,
and laughed as the plumes nodded above his
brow.  She saw the stately battle-axe brought
forth; she saw him take his keen sword in his
hand; he tried its edge, then waved it about
his head in the sunlight.  She laughed as it
glanced sparkling through the air; and even
while it was upheld she ran towards her father
to take a parting kiss.  Why was not the little
child afraid of the mighty king with the fierce
weapons?  Because he was her father; she
knew that he loved her, loved her as his own
life.  She knew that those dangerous weapons
would never be used against her unless to save
her from worse peril.  Do you understand
what uncle Gillette meant by this story?"
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly," said Lucy; "won't you tell me?"
</p>

<p>
"He meant," said Rosa, "that God is like
that mighty king.  Sickness, lightning, danger,
trial, death, are all His weapons; but we need
not fear them if we are truly His children.
When the sharp lightning flashes in the sky,
we can look calmly at its beauty, for it is in
our Father's hand.  Sickness may be around us,
but our Father can keep us safe.  Death may
come, but it will only be to send us to our
Father's arms."
</p>

<p>
"But I am not His child," half sobbed Lucy.
</p>

<p>
"His child you are, my dear little sister:
His loving, obedient child, I hope you will be."
</p>

<p>
At this moment the dinner-bell rang.  Rosa
waited till Lucy could wash away the traces of
her tears and smooth her hair, and then they
went down stairs together.  Mrs. Maxwell
looked up with a smile as Rosa came in; her
thoughtful deference was beginning to have its
effect.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah! for the small-pox!" shouted
Harty, as Lucy came in.  He had heard from
his father that the danger was imaginary, and,
forgetting his own fears, he quite despised
Lucy for her fright.
</p>

<p>
"Come here, my little patient," said the
doctor to the blushing child.  "I don't wonder
my pet was frightened: old Betsy ought to be
ashamed for being so foolish.  Poor Owen
M'Grath could injure no one; his sorrow is his
worst disease.  You see I made out the name
in your spelling, and I am obliged to my little
girl for trying to write the message so exactly.
Owen had as neat a little home as you could
wish to see, but it is a sad, sad place now.  His
poor wife has long been ill with consumption;
she died this noon, and there is no one to take
charge of his little baby but his daughter, who
is only as old as you are, Lucy."
</p>

<p>
"Can we not do something for them, father?"
asked Rosa.
</p>

<p>
"How like her mother," thought the doctor.
"Yes, dear child," he replied; "I will take
you to see them to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"May I go too?" asked Harty, eagerly.
</p>

<p>
The father smiled and nodded his head.
"We will not leave little Lucy behind, either,"
he added, to her great delight; "that is, if she
is well enough.  My pet looks a little pale yet.
You did well, Mrs. Maxwell, not to let her go
out this morning."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell gave a glance at Lucy, which
made her drop her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I shall not be at home to hear your
catechism this evening, Lucy," said Mrs. Maxwell,
as she left the dinner-table; "I am going to
see a sick friend after church, as Miss Rosa can
take my place at tea-time."
</p>

<p>
"Willingly," said Rosa, "and hear the
catechism too," she added, internally.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE HAPPY SUNDAY EVENING.
</h3>

<p>
Sunday afternoon passed away very rapidly
to Lucy.  She spent the time while her brother
and sister were at church in reading a little
book which Rosa had lent her.
</p>

<p>
As the children sat together in the twilight,
after tea, Rosa said to Lucy, "We used to call
you baby and pet at first: do you know when
we began to call you Lucy?"
</p>

<p>
"Not till I was two months old, I've heard
father say."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I well remember the morning that
you took your new name," continued Rosa.
"It was a bright day in June.  Dear mamma
was so kind and cheerful then.  I can see her
now as she came in to breakfast, so slender and
pale, and yet with such a calm, happy look on
her face.
</p>

<p>
"'You must call the baby Lucy after to-day,'
she said to me, as I kissed her that
morning.
</p>

<p>
"'And why, dear mother?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
"'Because she is to be baptized to-day, and
take Lucy for her Christian name,' answered
our mother.
</p>

<p>
"'But why is the baby to be baptized?' I
childishly asked.  She took no notice of my
question then; but after breakfast was over,
she called me to her side, and said, 'Shall I tell
my little girl a story?'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, do!' I answered, and she began.
</p>

<p>
"'There was once a little child who lived in
a very small cottage, with a scanty grass plat
before it.  This child had a pet lamb, of which
she was very fond.  She loved it so dearly that
she often sat on the door-step and anxiously
thought how she should ever be able to keep it
from harm as it grew older, and would be
tempted to run away from the cottage, around
which there was not even a light paling.  Then
winter must come, and how would the poor
little lamb be protected from the storm?
</p>

<p>
"'These thoughts were one day in the child's
mind, when an old traveller came to the cottage
door, and said to her, "I have a message to you,
dear child, from the shepherd who feeds his flock
on yonder green hill.  He has noticed you and
your little lamb, and he wants to be a friend to
you.  He knows that you will never be able to
keep your pet from harm, although you love it
so tenderly; and he bade me say to you, that
he is willing to take your lamb to be one of his
flock, to feed in that green pasture and drink
from the clear stream that is ever flowing there.
It shall be safely gathered to his fold when the
storms of winter beat, and shall be guarded
from all cruel beasts.  You can see it every
day, and caress it, though you must never try
to lead it away from him.  Shall we go
together and lead the little lamb to the kind
shepherd?"
</p>

<p>
"'"Yes!" shouted the child, joyfully; and
she took the old traveller's hand, and gently led
the lamb away by the blue ribbon that was
about its neck.
</p>

<p>
"'It was but a short distance they had to go,
yet the traveller found time to tell the child, as
they walked together, that if her lamb learned
to know the shepherd's voice, and follow him,
he would take it some day to a beautiful land,
where it could hunger and thirst no more;
where there would be no more storms, nor cruel
beasts, and where she might meet it and dwell
for ever with the kind shepherd and his blessed flock.
</p>

<p>
"'The child did not see the kind shepherd;
but the peaceful sheep, feeding on the delicate
food, or lying beside the clear water, were
there, and she did not fear to leave her pet
among them.  Day by day she saw her lamb
grow stronger and happier, and more pure and
gentle, and she rejoiced that she had placed it
among the favoured flock.
</p>

<p>
"'One day the little child grew dizzy and
faint: all things around her seemed fading
from her sight, and her dim eyes could only see
a strange figure which seemed beckoning her
away.
</p>

<p>
"'Then at her side she heard the voice of the
old traveller who had visited her before: "Fear
not," said he; "you are going to the beautiful
land where the kind shepherd dwells."  Then a
pang shot through the heart of the child, for
she thought of the lamb that she must leave
behind her.  The traveller guessed her thoughts,
and answered, "Your little lamb is in the care
of the kind shepherd!"  Then the eyes of the
child were bright, and she said, "I don't fear
for my little lamb: I am happy that I placed
him where he will be so tenderly cared for,
when I did not know that I so soon must leave
him.  May he learn to know the kind shepherd's
voice, and follow him, that we may meet
again in the beautiful land."
</p>

<p>
"'The cottage was soon all silence: the child
no longer went singing from room to room, but
she was happy, far away in the blessed land
which the kind shepherd prepared for his
faithful flock.'"
</p>

<p>
"'Did the little lamb go to meet her there?'
I asked, as dear mamma stopped as if she had
finished the story.
</p>

<p>
"'I cannot tell you, Rosa,' she answered,
and fast the tears fell from her eyes.  'By the
lamb I mean your little sister, and the kind
shepherd is the Saviour, to whom I am to give
her to-day.  God only knows whether our little
Lucy will reach the blessed land.'
</p>

<p>
"'But you are not going away, mamma, as
the child did,' I said, my eyes, too, filling with
tears, for I too well understood her meaning.
</p>

<p>
"'Perhaps not very soon,' she answered, and
smiled away her tears."
</p>

<p>
Lucy was still silent, and Rosa went on, for
both Harty and Lucy were earnestly listening.
</p>

<p>
"When you were carried up the aisle, dear
Lucy, all in your white clothing, you seemed
to me like the little lamb of which mother
had spoken, and I felt that you were being
received into the flock of the kind shepherd.  You
smiled when the water was sprinkled on your
forehead, and I was so glad, for that made you
seem willing to be placed in His care."
</p>

<p>
Lucy listened to the story of the child and
the lamb; and when she heard its explanation
her heart was full, and she inwardly resolved
that she would try so to follow the
Saviour here, that she might join her mother
at last in His blessed land.  As Rosa recalled
the circumstances of her Baptism, she for the
first time realized that it had really happened,
that her name had been really given by her
"sponsors in Baptism."
</p>

<p>
"Was I there too?" asked Harty, beginning
to be restless, as there was a short pause.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed! and so eager to see the
ceremony that you climbed on to the seat, and
leaned forward to look until you fell with a
loud noise, just as the baby was being carried
out of church.  You always were a noisy
fellow," said Rosa, as she laid her hand
affectionately on her brother's clustered curls.
</p>

<p>
"Did I cry?" asked Harty.
</p>

<p>
"No; you thought yourself too much of a
man for that, even then; and how fondly,
proudly, mamma looked at you, as you closed
your little lips and stood up without a sound,
though there was a bright red mark on your
forehead where you had struck it."
</p>

<p>
It seemed strange to Harty that he was willing
to sit still and listen to a girl; yet he found a
pleasure in being with Rosa different from any
he had ever felt.  He had always been quite
indifferent as to what Lucy thought of him,
but that Rosa should not be pleased with him
was a very unpleasant idea.  As a child he had
tenderly loved his mother; and when she was
taken from him, a blank had been left in his
heart which had never been filled.  Now half
the charm of Rosa's society consisted in her
being able to speak of that mother, and revive
his now fading remembrance of her.
</p>

<p>
"Come," said Rosa, "let us say our Catechism
together: I will ask the questions, and
we will all repeat the answers."
</p>

<p>
Lucy was delighted at the idea, and readily
joined her voice with Rosa's.  She found it
difficult to keep with her sister in reciting, as
Rosa repeated her answers slowly, as if she
really meant what she was saying.  As she
pronounced the words, "a member of Christ, a
child of God," she looked meaningly at Lucy;
and then it flashed through the little girl's
mind, that she was indeed the child of God, as
her sister had said; His child, not only because
He had made her, but because she had been
made His by Baptism; and again she resolved
to be His "loving, obedient child."
</p>

<p>
At first Harty did not join in saying the
Catechism; he had for some time given up the
practice as a thing only for such children as
Lucy; but when he saw that Rosa did not
think it beneath her, as they came to the
Apostles' Creed his voice mingled with the
others.  Rosa took no notice of it save that she
placed her hand in his, and they went on.  In
some of the long answers Lucy faltered, and
Harty halted entirely; but Rosa smoothly
continued until they could again join her.  As
Harty repeated the once familiar words, he
recalled the time when he had learned them from
that mother who was now a saint in Paradise.
With those familiar words returned the
precious lessons of love and holiness which she
had spoken, but which he had forgotten amid
the sport and recklessness of boyhood.
</p>

<p>
When they had finished, he was quite
softened, and his voice was very gentle as he
replied to Rosa's proposal to sing, "Yes, if I
know anything you do."
</p>

<p>
Lucy was fond of music, but she could not
sing: she laid her head on her sister's lap, and
listened to the simple hymns with a feeling of
peace and happiness.  Another and another
hymn was sung, until, at last, the clock struck nine.
</p>

<p>
"Nine o'clock," said Harty, "and Lucy not
in bed! what would Mrs. Maxwell say to
that?"
</p>

<p>
Lucy had been fast asleep, and was not a
little frightened when she heard it was so
late.  She took a candle immediately, kissed
her sister and wished her good night.  Oh! what
pleasure it gave her when Harty said,
"Me, too, if you please," and really looked
fondly in her face.
</p>

<p>
That night she forgot to look for robbers;
she was too happy to think of them; but she
did not forget the many blessings of the day
when she repeated her usual thanksgiving.
The same prayers she had often said she used
that evening; but they went up from her heart,
and were received in heaven for the Redeemer's sake.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
JUDY M'GRATH.
</h3>

<p>
Often, during school-hours on Monday, the
promised visit to Owen M'Grath's came into
Lucy's mind, and she longed for four o'clock to
come, that she might be at liberty.  School
was over at last, and with the pleasant
consciousness of having done well the duties of the
day, Lucy tripped towards home.  Julia Staples
had tried several times to draw her into a
whispered conversation, but she had resisted
the temptation; and when Julia offered her an
apple, and put her arm in hers, to draw her
aside for a confidential chat, Lucy refused the
gift and got away as soon as she could with
politeness.  She had learned that the first step
towards doing right, is to keep as much as
possible out of the way of temptation; and she
knew that Julia's society roused her evil
feelings.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, how stuck-up somebody is!"
said Julia Staples to one of her companions, as
Lucy turned away.
</p>

<p>
Lucy heard the remark, and her face flushed
slightly, but she made no reply.
</p>

<p>
Julia did not offer to accompany Lucy home,
but with two of the scholars, who were much
like herself, she walked behind the little girl,
"making fun of her."  Of this Lucy knew
nothing.  Lightly and rapidly she walked
along, not looking behind her, but welcoming
each turn in the road that brought her nearer
home.
</p>

<p>
Rosa and Harty were standing at the door to
meet her.  "I do believe you were kept in,"
began Harty; "we have been waiting for you
this half-hour."
</p>

<p>
"Come, come! young gentleman," interposed
Rosa playfully, "you are in such a hurry
to wait on the ladies, that the time seems long
to you.  It is but five minutes past four."
</p>

<p>
The teased, fretted expression that was
coming over Lucy's face passed away in an
instant, and Harty's impatience was changed to
a smile.
</p>

<p>
The children, set off together in high spirits.
Even Rosa, although she know she was going
to the house of mourning, caught something
of their spirit, and chatted cheerfully by the
way.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Vale was just driving up to Owen's door
when they arrived.
</p>

<p>
"That's right! all punctual," said he, as he
alighted; and when he looked upon their
bright faces, he felt thankful that his little
group had been so far spared from sickness and
death.  The happy young voices were hushed
in an instant, as they entered the dark, quiet
room, into which the street-door opened.
There was but a little furniture, and that of the
plainest sort, yet all was neat and tidy.  The
pale, lifeless form of the mother was stretched
upon the bed, and close at its side there nestled
a sleeping infant, rosy with health.
</p>

<p>
The little girl, who was sitting beside them, her
head on her hands, jumped up as the strangers
came in.  She instantly recognised the doctor, and
said, in a low voice, "Won't the docther plase to
be sated, and the young gintleman and ladies?"
</p>

<p>
Noiselessly she put forward the chairs, and
whispered as she did so, "Whisht! the poor
babby has been grievin' so I could not hush him
at all, and sorra a bit would he sleep till I laid
him there by poor mammy, and then he cuddled
up to her cold side and seemed quite contint."
</p>

<p>
"Poor baby!" said Rosa, the tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
They all drew near to the bed, and looked
into the face of the dead.  Harty gave one
glance and then stepped to the door; he could
not bear it; he felt a choking in his throat to
which he was quite unaccustomed.
</p>

<p>
As Rosa and Lucy looked upon the calm,
sweet expression of the face, they felt no chill
of horror.  Death seemed less terrible to Lucy
than it had ever done before.  "She is happy
now?" half questioned she of Rosa.
</p>

<p>
Rosa looked puzzled, but the doctor replied,
"Yes, she is happy.  'I'm going home,' were
her last words.  She has only gone to be with
the Friend whom she has served faithfully
through life."
</p>

<p>
"Did you say mammy was happy?" asked
Judy, the little girl who had been acting as
nurse.
</p>

<p>
"Happy with the angels in heaven," was
the doctor's reply.
</p>

<p>
"Then I'd not want her back again, to be
sorrying here.  Little peace she's had, with
that misery in her side, for many a day.  Why,
the lifting of Larry there, was enough to make
her all put to it for an hour.  Poor fayther, he
can't get along with it all: sorra a bit has he
tasted to-day, and he cried fit to break his heart
when he went away to work this morning; but
he said he must go, for he'd niver a sixpence to
pay for the burying."
</p>

<p>
The poor little girl had been so long alone
that it seemed to be quite a relief to her to talk
to some one who felt for her.
</p>

<p>
"You'll be a comfort to him, I know," said
Rosa, gently.
</p>

<p>
"I'll lave nothing untiched that I can turn
my hand to," answered Judy, earnestly.
</p>

<p>
The talking, although it was in a low voice,
waked Larry, and he began to moan piteously.
He put out his hand, touched the cold face near
him, and then drew it quickly away.  He
half-raised his head, but seeing that it was his
mother's cheek that had so startled him, he
again put forth his hand and patted her gently
until he was again asleep.
</p>

<p>
"And what will poor Larry do when they lay
her in the cold ground?" said little Judy, half
crying.
</p>

<p>
"He will soon be comforted," whispered
Rosa: "God will take care of you both.  It
must have been a long time since your mother
has been able to sew," she continued, to divert
Judy's mind from her trouble.
</p>

<p>
"Ach! yes.  She has not set a stitch for two
months gone; and there's Larry, with sorra a
bit of clothes but them he has on, savin' this
thrifle of a frock that I've been trying to wash
for the burying."
</p>

<p>
As she said this she put her hand on a little
faded calico frock that was hanging near the
window.
</p>

<p>
"I think we can get some clothes for Larry,"
said Rosa: "may I take this home with me for
a pattern?"
</p>

<p>
Judy looked a little confused, but she
answered, "Sartainly, miss."
</p>

<p>
"Can you sew, Judy?" asked Rosa.
</p>

<p>
"I never was learnt," was Judy's reply.
</p>

<p>
"Would you like to have me teach you?  If
you would, you may come to me every Saturday
morning, and I will show you how."
</p>

<p>
Judy's eyes brightened, and she was going
to accept the offer very gladly, when she
thought of Larry, and changed her mind.
</p>

<p>
"I can't lave Larry; there's nobody but me
to mind him now."
</p>

<p>
"You may bring him with you; I know Lucy
here will take care of him," said Rosa.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, I will, if he won't be afraid to
stay with me," said Lucy.
</p>

<p>
Before they left the house it was agreed that
Judy should come the next Saturday morning
for her first lesson in sewing, if her father did
not object.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Vale, who had been standing without
the door with Harty, met the girls as they
came out.  He stepped back when Judy was
alone, and placed some money in her hand,
telling her to give it to her father, and say to
him, that his children should not want for a
friend while Dr. Vale was in the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
Judy curtseyed, and spoke her thanks as well
as she was able, but they were not heard, for
the doctor hurried away, and in a few moments
had driven from the door.
</p>

<p>
Very little was said on the way home.  As
they passed an old house, with a rough, high
fence about it, Harty told his sisters that this
was where the people had been sick with small-pox.
</p>

<p>
Lucy clasped Rosa's hand a little closer, and
they both stopped more rapidly.
</p>

<p>
"Father says nobody need be afraid, for they
have all got well, and nobody took it from
them," said Harty.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding this assurance, all the party
felt more easy when the house with the high
fence was out of sight.
</p>

<p>
"Let us stop here and buy the cloth for
Larry's frocks," said Rosa, as they reached the
village shop.
</p>

<p>
While Rosa was looking at some cheap
woollen cloth, Harty was fumbling in his
pockets.  He drew out some marbles, an old
knife, a peg-top, and some bits of string, and
at last he found what he was seeking&mdash;a
half-crown, with which he had intended to buy some
new fishing-tackle.  He gave one longing look
at the money, and then handed it to Rosa,
saying, "Take that for the cloth."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said she, very quietly; but a bright,
loving smile was on her face, and Harty felt,
happy, although he was blushing as if he had
been in mischief.  Like many boys, Harty
seemed to feel more ashamed when he did right
than when he did wrong.
</p>

<p>
When the children were gathered round the
table in the evening, Rosa brought out the old
dress, and was just putting the scissors to it
when Mrs. Maxwell exclaimed, "What are you
doing, child? are you going to cut that dress to
pieces?"
</p>

<p>
"I was going to rip it for a pattern,"
answered Rosa, mildly.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you think I could not cut out a
frock nice enough for a little Paddy boy," said
Mrs. Maxwell.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, I did not think that!" Rosa replied,
smiling; "I should be very glad to have
you help us."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell took the scissors, and the
frocks were soon cut out, much to Rosa's relief,
for although she had resolved to do it, it was
her first attempt at dressmaking, and she was
afraid that she should only spoil the cloth.
</p>

<p>
Then the sewing commenced, and the needles
flew so fast that there was little time for talking.
Lucy was allowed to make the skirt, and she
sewed it as carefully as if it had been an apron
for her doll, and that was very nicely.
Mrs. Maxwell put on her spectacles and began to
sew too, much to Rosa's surprise; and once she
offered to turn the hem for Lucy, when she saw
that she was troubled.  It seemed as if the
work they were doing put them all in a good
humour, for every face was bright and happy.
Even Harty felt as if he had something to do
in the business, and instead of fidgeting about
as usual, annoying everybody, he sat very still
for some time, doing no harm, but breaking off
thread from the ball and tying it into knots.
At last he said, "Shall I read to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, do," said Rosa and Lucy, both at once.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I will, if Lucy will get my Natural
History off my table."
</p>

<p>
Lucy jumped up in a moment, and ran for the
book: the hall-lamp showed her the way until
she got to the room door, and then, by the faint
starlight, she easily found the volume.  There
were other books which Rosa would have
preferred, and Harty was a very dull reader; but
she listened patiently, and got quite interested
at last in an account of an elephant that went
mad in London, a favourite story with Harty.
</p>

<p>
Lucy was very sorry when bed-time arrived;
but there was not a word to be said, for
Mrs. Maxwell put the lamp in her hand, and bade
her "Good night" most decidedly.
</p>

<p>
As Lucy entered her own pretty room, she
thought of little Judy watching beside her dead
mother in that poor cottage, and she wondered
that it had never struck her before that God
had surrounded her with so many blessings.
</p>

<p>
Judy's washing had not been very well done,
and as Rosa thought best to send back the little
frock as soon as possible, she was in haste to
have it made clean.
</p>

<p>
After Lucy had gone to bed, she went to
the kitchen with it in her hand.  Old Betsy
was sitting by the fire, looking very stupid
and cross.  Rosa was almost afraid to ask her
to do what she had intended.  She took courage,
however, and said, "Betsy, I want you to wash
this little frock for a poor boy who has no other
to wear but the one he has on.  I know you
would be glad to do it, if you had seen the poor
little fellow lying by his dead mother: he has
nobody at home to wash his clothes now."
</p>

<p>
Betsy had looked very sour when Rosa
commenced, but softened as she continued to speak,
and when Rosa finished, she took the little
frock in her hand, saying, "I suppose I shall
ketch something, handling this thing, but I
can't say no to you, for you are the image
of your mother."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Betsy," said Rosa; "I hope
I may be like my mother.  You need not do
the frock to-night; it will be time enough in
the morning.  The funeral is not till three
o'clock to-morrow afternoon, and I can get
Harty to take it down after school."
</p>

<p>
"I guess Master Harty will not be running
for anybody," said Betsy to herself, as Rosa
went up stairs; but she was wrong: Harty
did go, and took with him, besides, a penny
cake, that he had bought for Larry.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
THE VISITOR.
</h3>

<p>
Rapidly, happily, the weeks flew by at
Dr. Vale's cottage: there seemed to be a new
spirit at work there.  Lucy no longer looked
sad and drooping: there was always a bright
face to welcome her return from school, and
some one to listen to her account of the occurrences
of the day.  If her lessons were difficult,
Rosa was always ready to explain them, and
to encourage her to more persevering study.
By degrees, Lucy was learning to share all
her feelings with her sister.  Sometimes Rosa
found these confidences rather tiresome, but
she never checked them, as she Was anxious
that Lucy should speak to her without
restraint, that they might be able to talk freely
on the most important of subjects.
</p>

<p>
Many of Lucy's fears seemed to have passed
away without effort as she became more
cheerful; others she had been enabled to conquer
by Rosa's kind advice; but the great secret
of the new courage that she seemed acquiring,
was found in the few words, "God is with me,
God loves me," which were seldom far from
Lucy's mind.
</p>

<p>
At first she could not help feeling that when
she had done wrong, God had ceased to love
her.  Then Rosa would read to her passages
from the Bible where the Saviour speaks of
having come to save sinners, and would
remind her, again and again, that she was God's
own child.
</p>

<p>
"God made you, my dear Lucy," she would
frequently say; "and He loves everything
that He has made, and 'would not that any
of His little ones should perish.'  Christ has
died that you may be forgiven; He has
promised to receive all that truly come unto Him;
His child you were made in Baptism, and His
child you are glad to be; then why should you
fear?"
</p>

<p>
"It seems so strange that God is willing to
forgive me so often," Lucy would reply, "I
can hardly believe it."
</p>

<p>
"It is, indeed, most wonderful; but for
Christ's sake His poor erring followers are
received, if they truly repent," would Rosa
answer.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could be perfect in a minute," said
Lucy, one day; "I get tired of trying."
</p>

<p>
"When Christ has done so much for us that
wo may share His happy home in heaven, we
ought to be willing to stay here as long as He
pleases, and strive to follow His example.  If
we prayed more earnestly for God to assist us,
we should find it easier to do right; for God
gives His Holy Spirit freely to them that ask
Him.  If you can constantly remember that
God is with you, you will soon learn to turn
to Him when you are tempted," answered Rosa.
</p>

<p>
Lucy thought that Rosa had no trouble to
do right always; but it was a mistake.  Many
times hasty words came to Rosa's lips, and
unkind thoughts were offered to her mind;
but they wore followed so quickly by the effort
to subdue them, and the prayer for aid, that
they never were made known to those around her.
</p>

<p>
Cold winter weather had come: it seemed to
make Harty only the more full of life and
spirits.  When he came in from the keen air,
there was always a bustle in the circle round
the fire.  Sometimes he would lay his cold
hands suddenly on Lucy's neck, and shout with
laughter as she shivered and drew away;
sometimes Rosa's cheeks got rubbed with a
snow-ball until they were redder than usual;
and almost always the noisy fellow was
reproved by Mrs. Maxwell for bringing in so
much snow or mud on his boots.
</p>

<p>
Yet Rosa was learning to love her rough
brother very dearly, and she even fancied she
could see some improvement in him.  After a long
talk with his sister, he would be more gentle
and quiet for a few days; but soon some trifle
would throw him into a passion, and all his
goodness departed.  He was so accustomed to
speaking rudely to Lucy, that he never thought
of it afterwards; yet he was mortified when in
his fits of passion he had been unkind to Rosa.
</p>

<p>
She never seemed to retain any remembrance
of his fault, but was ready to meet him
pleasantly again as soon as his bad humour had
passed away.
</p>

<p>
He could not help admiring her noble spirit;
and every day he felt more and more sure that
there was some strength in the principles that
could keep a high-spirited girl like Rosa
uniformly gentle.
</p>

<p>
By degrees Harty took less pleasure in teasing
Lucy, and more happiness in her society.  She
had followed Rosa's hints, and tried not to be
vexed and hurt by trifles, and really was
becoming more interesting as she grew more
cheerful and talkative.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Vale was still obliged to be very much
away from home, but the time that he could
spend with his family he greatly enjoyed; and
he often rejoiced that Rosa had been brought
home to throw around her such an atmosphere
of sunshine.
</p>

<p>
Even Mrs. Maxwell had relaxed a little from
her stiffness: she occasionally allowed Rosa to
put Harty's room in order at first, and finally
she gave up that charge entirely to her.  This
arrangement prevented much disturbance, for
Rosa handled carefully the veriest trash, which
she knew had value in Harty's eyes; and there
were no more broken cobwebs to put him out of temper.
</p>

<p>
Often, when Mrs. Maxwell was weary, she
found a comfortable chair placed for her by the
fire; when her eyes were painful at night,
unasked, Rosa would read the daily paper
aloud.  Such trifling attentions were very
grateful to the faithful housekeeper, and it
soon became a favourite joke with Harty to
call Rosa "Mrs. Maxwell's pet."
</p>

<p>
As regularly as Saturday came, little Judy
appeared, leading Larry by the hand, for he
was now nearly two years old, and a fine
healthy boy.
</p>

<p>
Lucy often wished that she could stay in the
room with Rosa and Judy, but the latter could
never attend to her sewing while her little
brother was in her presence.  She was
constantly stopping to bid him say, "Thank ye"
to the lady, or shame him for running about as
if he were as much at home as the ladies.
</p>

<p>
Lucy found it very easy to amuse Larry, and
before long she grew fond of him, and looked
forward with pleasure to his Saturday visit.
</p>

<p>
With Harty's consent, and Mrs. Maxwell's
valuable assistance, some of his old clothes
were "cut down" for Larry, and he was
warmly dressed in a good great-coat and cap,
that delighted him exceedingly, though Judy
could not help laughing when she first saw him
in them.
</p>

<p>
Judy learned much more than the use of the
needle from Rosa.  As she sat sewing, Rosa
taught her many sweet hymns and passages
from Scripture, and led her to look to her kind
Heavenly Father as a friend who would "never
leave nor forsake her."
</p>

<p>
The short winter days and the long winter
evenings soon passed away.  One bright spring
morning Lucy was looking at the hyacinths
that were blooming beside the cottage wall,
when she heard a footstep, and, turning round,
she saw a stranger standing beside her.  Once
she would have started away like a frightened
bird; but now she did not think of herself, but
waited politely until the stranger should
announce his errand.
</p>

<p>
"The flowers are peeping forth again; I see
you love them," he said, cheerfully; "and
what a place this is for birds; I never heard
such a twittering.  Are there any robins in the
old nest at the bottom of the garden?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, they have come," answered Lucy,
wondering who could know so well about the
robin's nest.
</p>

<p>
"We ought to be friends, Lucy," continued
the stranger's pleasant voice, "for I could hush
you when you were a baby, when nobody else
could make you stop crying.  You were a fat
little thing then, and you are not so very much
heavier now."  And he jumped the little girl
high in the air.
</p>

<p>
Lucy by this time had made up her mind,
that whoever the stranger might be, she liked
him.
</p>

<p>
"Can it be uncle Gillette?" she had once
thought to herself; but she immediately decided
that it was not he, as she had always imagined
him very stern, with large black eyes, and the
stranger's face was mild and cheerful, and his
eyes were of a soft hazel.
</p>

<p>
"I have more little friends in the house,"
said the gentleman, and with Lucy's hand in
his, he entered the door.  Rosa was half-way
down stairs; she caught one glimpse of the
stranger, and then gave a flying leap, which
nearly brought her to his side.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! uncle Gillette, I am so glad to see
you," she said, as he bent to kiss her,
apparently as delighted as herself.
</p>

<p>
Harty came out to see what was the cause of
all this commotion, and was greeted with a
cordial shake of the hand, and the address, "I
hope Harty has not forgotten his old playfellow,
uncle Gillette."
</p>

<p>
The children thought their father welcomed
their uncle somewhat coldly; but they changed
their minds when they found that he had been
expecting him for several days, and had
accompanied him from the station to the gate.
</p>

<p>
Lucy had supposed that she should be very
much afraid of Mr. Gillette, as she knew that
he was very learned and good; but she found
him as mild and simple as a little child, and
she was most happy to take the low stool he
placed for her at his side, and look into his
pleasant face, while she listened to his
conversation.
</p>

<p>
She was heartily sorry when she heard him
say that he was to leave on Monday morning,
for as it was Saturday, they would have but a
short visit from him.
</p>

<p>
There was no settled clergyman at Chatford
at this time, the rector being absent for the
benefit of his health.  On this account a long
time had passed since the children of the parish
had been catechised in the church.  There was
therefore no small bustle among the little
people when it was announced on the Sunday
morning after Mr. Gillette's arrival, that the
children would be called upon to recite the
Catechism that afternoon, immediately after
the service.
</p>

<p>
There was much buzzing and studying at
noon; and many a boy was astonished that he
had forgotten what was once so familiar to him,
in the long interval which had passed since the
last catechising.
</p>

<p>
Even Lucy was glad to study over what she
called the "long answers," although she never
failed to repeat them with her brother and
sister every Sunday evening.  She did not
dare to lay her Prayer Book aside until Rosa
had patiently heard her say the whole
Catechism, and pronounced it perfectly learned.
</p>

<p>
Many young hearts that had palpitated with
fear at the idea of reciting to a stranger, were
reassured when the Rev. Mr. Gillette arose
after the Evening Service, and said, "The
children may now come up to the chancel."
</p>

<p>
Without a thought that any one was observing
her, Lucy stepped out and joined the
throng of boys and girls that were moving up
the aisle.  Julia Staples was tittering in the
pew behind, and Judy M'Grath was walking at
her side; but she did not see either of them;
she felt that she was in God's holy temple, and
about to perform a solemn duty, and she
inwardly prayed that she might be able to
understand and improve by Mr. Gillette's
explanations.
</p>

<p>
The children were allowed to recite together,
and their voices joined in a full chorus, as
they answered correctly all the questions of the
Catechism.  Glances of triumph and congratulation
passed from eye to eye as they finished,
or not once had they faltered, even in the
most difficult parts.
</p>

<p>
"What is the Catechism?" asked Mr. Gillette.
</p>

<p>
"It is a preparation for Confirmation,"
answered one of the boys.
</p>

<p>
"You have all recited the Catechism perfectly;
are you then prepared to be confirmed?"
said Mr. Gillette.
</p>

<p>
There was no answer for a moment, and all
looked confused; at length there was a faint "No."
</p>

<p>
"I fear not," continued Mr. Gillette: "how,
then, must you say this Catechism before you
are ready to be confirmed?"
</p>

<p>
"We must speak it from the heart," said
Judy M'Grath.
</p>

<p>
Some of the boys smiled at her Irish accent,
but one glance from Mr. Gillette sobered them.
</p>

<p>
"Right!  When do you take upon yourselves
the promises made for you by your
sponsors in Baptism?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"At Confirmation," several replied.
</p>

<p>
"True," said Mr. Gillette, "at Confirmation
you take these promises publicly upon
yourselves.  I see many before me," said he,
looking tenderly about him, "who are too
young for Confirmation, but hardly a child
who is not old enough to make those solemn
promises to God in private, and strive earnestly
to keep them.  Do not wait, my dear children,
until you are old enough to be confirmed,
before you promise to love and obey the
Saviour who has redeemed you.  Your sponsors
laid you as infants on His bosom; turn
not from Him with your first feeble footsteps.
You were made members of Christ at Baptism;
ask God this day to help you to live as the
lambs of His flock.  If you commence now to
strive to keep your baptismal promises,
Confirmation will indeed be, as it ought, a
strengthening of you in all that is good, an
assistance in leading that holy life which
becomes the children of God, the members of
Christ, and the inheritors of the kingdom of
heaven.
</p>

<p>
"Let me ask you once more, Do you not
believe that you are bound to believe and do as
your sponsors promised for you?  Let me hear
that answer again, and may God give you
strength to speak it from the heart."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, verily, and by God's help so I will;
and I heartily thank our Heavenly Father that
He has called me to this state of salvation,
through Jesus Christ our Lord," was heard
from the throng around the chancel.
</p>

<p>
Even those who stood nearest to Lucy could
hardly hear her voice; no human friend saw
her uplifted eye; but God, who seeth all hearts,
accepted the vow she made in His holy temple,
and she felt more fully than she had ever done
before, that she was indeed the child of God.
</p>

<p>
Lucy was not the only child who had listened
earnestly to Mr. Gillette.  It was the last time
that he ever addressed those children; but
there will be those at the resurrection who will
thank him for the words he spoke that day:
good resolutions were then roused in young
hearts, which strengthened until they became
strong principles, which supported through life,
sustained in death, and were perfected in
heaven.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
SICKNESS.
</h3>

<p>
All was changed at Dr. Vale's cottage on
Monday noon: Mrs. Maxwell, Harty, and Lucy
once more sat down to dinner by themselves.
The doctor was with a distant patient, and
Rosa had gone with Mr. Gillette, to pass a few
days in the city.
</p>

<p>
Although Mr. Gillette had been with them so
short a time, both Harty and Lucy were sorry
to part with him; and they did not wonder at
Rosa's strong attachment to their uncle.
</p>

<p>
Lucy felt very sad when it was first proposed
that Rosa should leave home, although it was
only for a few days; but she knew this was a
selfish feeling, and struggled to overcome it.
Early on Monday morning the packing of
Rosa's trunk commenced.  Lucy ran about to
wait on her sister, and helped her in her
preparations as cheerfully as if she herself were of
the party; she even insisted upon lending her
certain belts and ribbons which were the
treasures of her wardrobe.
</p>

<p>
Harty was not up when the carriage came to
the door; he had been called once, but had
fallen asleep again.  He thrust his tumbled
head from the window, and bade his sister a
hearty farewell as she drove from the door.
</p>

<p>
This little circumstance seemed to have put
him in a bad humour for the day.  He pushed
away his plate at breakfast, declaring he would
not eat a mouthful of such trash; although
everything was very nice, and there were hot
cakes, of which he was usually very fond.
Notwithstanding Harty's ill-humours, he was a
favourite with old Betsy, and she was always
careful to send him up a good breakfast, even
when he had been lazy.
</p>

<p>
At dinner, his temper did not seem to have
improved.  "How you do eat," he said to
Lucy: "it takes away my appetite to see you
stuff so.  I will speak to father about it."
</p>

<p>
Poor Lucy looked up in surprise, for she was
only quietly taking a moderate meal.  Once
she would have answered pettishly or begun to
cry, but Rosa had taught her that a cheerful as
well as a soft answer often turneth away wrath,
and she smilingly replied, "Why, Harty, I
shall not be a stout, rosy girl soon, unless I
make good dinners.  Do try some of this
horse-radish, it will make you relish your dinner as
well as I do."
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!" exclaimed Harty, impatiently,
"you need not try so hard to be like Rosa: you
can never hit it; you are as unlike as an acorn
to an apple."
</p>

<p>
Lucy blushed, and was glad that Mrs. Maxwell
spoke to her just then, for she was hurt
by her brother's rudeness, and tempted to make
a hasty reply.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell wanted a certain apron for a
pattern, and Lucy ran for it as soon as dinner
was over, little thinking that even Mrs. Maxwell
had learned something from Rosa, and had
spoken to her at that moment to change the
conversation.
</p>

<p>
Lucy really felt sorry to see Harty come into
the dining-room after tea, as if he intended to
spend the evening there, for the frown was on
his brow.  She was about to ask him why he
did not go to see John Staples, when she
remembered that Rosa had said that John was a
bad companion, and that sisters ought to do
everything to make their home pleasant, even
when their brothers were cross and disagreeable;
for boys were often led into temptation when
out of the house, from which they were safe
when at home.
</p>

<p>
With these thoughts in her mind Lucy laid
aside a mark which she was working for Rosa,
and which she was anxious to finish before her
return, and went for the chequer-board.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you want to beat me?" she asked
gently of Harty.
</p>

<p>
"It is so easy to do that, I don't care for it,"
was his reply.
</p>

<p>
The little girl was not discouraged; she took
out her scrap-book and pictures, and the bottle
of gum-arabic, and placed them on the table.
She knew Harty would be sure to take an
interest in some new engravings which one of the
school-girls had that day given her.
</p>

<p>
A spirited engraving of a wild horse caught
his eye, and he soon was engaged in looking
over the addition to the old stock, and in
advising Lucy where to paste them.  One of the
engravings he claimed as his own.  Lucy knew
perfectly that he was mistaken, but she gave it
to him without a word; and when he laughed
at her awkward way of using the brush, she
joined in the laugh, holding up her sticky fingers
in a comical way.
</p>

<p>
Presently Harty put his head on the table,
and fell fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
"Harty must be unwell," said Mrs. Maxwell,
as she roused him from his heavy sleep, and
told him he had better go up to bed.
</p>

<p>
Grumbling at being waked, he disappeared,
without saying Good night to anybody.
</p>

<p>
Rosa's room looked lonely and deserted to
Lucy as she passed it that night; and she
wondered, as she put the lamp down on her
own little table, where her sister was, and
what she was doing.
</p>

<p>
That pretty room was a different place to
Lucy from what it once was.  She did not think
of looking for robbers now; she had given
that up long ago; and when she looked out of
the pleasant window, the stars seemed like
spirits, that told her of the power of the great
God, who was her friend.  She had ceased to
hear mysterious noises in the orchard; the
stillness of the night was only disturbed by the
twittering of some restless bird, or the waving
of the tender leaves in the soft wind; but Lucy
felt no fear as she looked out upon the quiet
scene.  Once she had been afraid of ghosts,
and often feared at night to see some white
figure rise before her; but since she had learned
to love the ever-present, invisible God, she felt
safe from all harm, whether from spirits or evil
men.  Lucy liked to be alone now, that she
might think about the gentle Saviour who was
ever with her.  To that Saviour she spoke in
sincere prayer that night.  Her brother was
not forgotten: she prayed that God might
watch over him and make him truly good, and
as she did so there was not a harsh feeling in
her heart towards him, notwithstanding his
unkindness during the day.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of the night Lucy woke suddenly:
she did not long doubt as to what had
roused her, for the rain was falling in torrents,
and soon there was a heavy clap of thunder, at
almost the same moment that the room was lit
by the glare of lightning.  Lucy lay very still:
she could not help feeling that there was some
danger, but she was calm and peaceful.  "The
lightning is in God's hand, my Father's hand,"
she thought.  "He will take care of me;" and
she was soon almost asleep again.  A loud
groan made her start up in bed and listen.  It
was repeated, and seemed to come from Harty's
room.  Without a thought but of alarm for her
brother, she slipped on her shoes, and throwing
her little wrapper about her, she ran to him.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter, Harty?" film asked,
as she stood by his side.
</p>

<p>
"Go away! they'll not get me; I know
where to hide," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
"Wake up, Harty," said Lucy, "there's
nobody trying to catch you."
</p>

<p>
The lightning lit the room, and she saw that
her brother's eyes were wide open, and that his
cheeks were flushed.  She took his hand; it was
burning hot: he snatched it from her, saying,
"Let me go, John, you don't play fair."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know me, brother?" said Lucy,
leaning over him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, Thomas; tell Betsy to bake me
some cakes," was his reply.
</p>

<p>
Poor Lucy! what should she do?  She did
not like to leave her brother to call Mrs. Maxwell;
yet something, she knew, ought to be
done for him immediately.  At length she
thought to knock on the wall, and wake
Mrs. Maxwell, as her room was next to Harty's.
</p>

<p>
"What, afraid again?" said Mrs. Maxwell,
as she saw Lucy standing by her brother's
bed.
</p>

<p>
A groan from Harty, and a few muttered
words, immediately drew her attention to him.
</p>

<p>
"I told you he was ill last night; why, how
hot he is!  Harty, what ails you?" said
Mrs. Maxwell in a breath.
</p>

<p>
Harty could not tell what ailed him, for he
was delirious with fever.
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do?" said Mrs. Maxwell,
desperately: "your father won't be home till
near morning, I know, and I am afraid to give
any medicine, for he always scolds about my
'dosing the children.'"
</p>

<p>
"But Harty ought to have something done
for him, I am sure," said Lucy.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll do what we can to put him in a
perspiration," said Mrs. Maxwell.  "I'll go to
the kitchen and make him some hot drink, and
get hot water for his feet, and may be that'll
be the best thing till the doctor comes home."  So
saying, she disappeared with the light she
had brought in her hand.
</p>

<p>
Lucy put on her brother's great coat, that
lay on a chair; for the storm had cooled the
air, and she was quite chilly.  Thus equipped,
she began to act the nurse as well as she could.
Her first step was to light a lamp.  Harty had
a nice lucifer-box on his shelf: she felt
carefully for it, and managed to find it without
knocking down any of his treasures.
</p>

<p>
Not a thought of fear crossed her mind,
although Mrs. Maxwell had gone to the kitchen
in the basement, and there was no one near to
aid her, if her brother should attempt in his
delirium to injure her.  Love to God made her
trust in His protection; love to her brother
made her forgetful of danger to herself while
striving to be useful to him.  She bathed his
burning forehead, and moistened his parched
lips, and often spoke to him tenderly, hoping
he might answer her naturally.  Sometimes,
for a moment, she fancied he knew her, but as
she bent to catch his words, some unmeaning
sentence would convince her she was mistaken.
How welcome was the sound of her father's
footstep!  Unconscious of any evil, Dr. Vale
entered the house, and was hurried to Harty's
bedside.  Lucy watched his face as he felt her
brother's pulse and noticed his other symptoms,
and her heart grew sadder yet as she read his
deep anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell told him how fretful and
indifferent to food Harty had appeared during
the day, and of his unusual nap in the evening;
and as she did so, Lucy felt grateful that she
had borne pleasantly with her brother's
ill-humour, which had, no doubt, been caused in
part by disease.  How painful her feelings
would have been if she had treated him with
unkindness, though with ever so great
provocation!  Children can never know how soon the
illness or death of their friends may make
them bitterly lament the slightest harshness
towards them.
</p>

<p>
When Dr. Vale had given Harty such medicines
as he thought most sure to give him relief,
he for the first time noticed Lucy, who had
kept by the bedside.  Even in his sadness, he
almost smiled at the funny little figure wrapped
in the thick coat, with only the face visible,
looking out from the nightcap.
</p>

<p>
"Go to bed, child; you can do no good here,
and it will make you ill to lose your sleep," he
said to her, gently.
</p>

<p>
"But, father," she pleaded, "I shall not
sleep if I do go to bed; I can't bear to leave
poor Harty."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Maxwell and I can do all that is
needed for him to-night, my dear," said he,
kissing her sorrowful face.  "To-morrow we
shall want you to run about and wait on us.
Go, take some rest, like a good child, that you
may be able to be useful in the morning."
</p>

<p>
With this motive to console her, Lucy went
to her room.  When there, all the fearful
reality of Harty's illness came fully upon her.
He might be taken from her, she thought, and
at the very idea her tears flowed fast, and her
heart throbbed with distress.  Lucy did not
long forget the heavenly Friend to whom she
had learned to go in all her trials.  Now she
prayed earnestly to Him to spare her brother's
life, or grant him his reason, that he might be
able to realize his awful situation if he indeed
must die.  After this prayer she felt more
composed, although very, very sad.  At last
she fell asleep, and did not wake until the sun
was several hours high.
</p>

<p>
Her first thought in waking was of her
brother.  She stole gently to his door.
Mrs. Maxwell was sitting beside him: she motioned
to Lucy to go away, and made a sign that
Harty was sleeping.
</p>

<p>
The sorrow and anxiety of that day would
have been harder for Lucy to bear, if she had
not been so busy.  Mrs. Maxwell did not leave
the sick-room, and Dr. Vale was there nearly
all the time; but unwilling as he was to leave
his son, he was obliged to visit other patients
several times during the day.
</p>

<p>
Lucy was kept almost constantly in motion.
She brought for Mrs. Maxwell what was
needed from the surgery or the kitchen, and
carried messages in all directions.  She
carefully placed a little chair by the door, and
there she sat silently, to be ready whenever
she might be wanted.
</p>

<p>
Lucy did not ask her father any questions,
but she hoped from hour to hour to hear him
say that her brother was better; but no such
cheering words fell from his lips.
</p>

<p>
Towards evening he hastily wrote a letter,
and said to Lucy, as he handed it to her to
send to the post, "I have written to Rosa to
come home immediately.  Tell Patty to have
a room ready for Mr. Gillette; he will return with her."
</p>

<p>
These words were full of dreadful meaning
to Lucy.  Harty must be very ill, she knew,
or Rosa would not have been sent for.
Throwing aside her usual quiet manner, she
clasped her father round the neck and sobbed
upon his bosom.  "Dear, dear father," she
whispered, "do you think Harty will die?"
</p>

<p>
"God may spare him," said Dr. Vale, his
strong frame shaking with emotion, and the
tears in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Lucy had never seen her father so much
moved before, and she felt sure that he had
very little hope that her brother would be
well again.
</p>

<p>
She ceased sobbing, and a strange calmness
came over her.  Every impatient or unkind
word that she had ever spoken to Harty came
back to her; and oh how solemnly she
resolved, if he should recover, to be a better
sister to him than she had ever been before!
She tried to remember something that Harty
had said which could make her feel sure that
he would be happy in heaven, if he should
die.  She thought of the Sunday evening
when he had bid her "Good night" so kindly,
and joined in saying the Catechism; of the
first Sunday that he had made a prayer on
entering church; and of the many times that
he had listened with interest while Rosa talked
of the Saviour.  But these recollections did
not set her mind at rest.  She knew that God
had said, "My son, give me thine heart;" and
she felt sadly sure that Harty had never, in
sincerity, given his heart to God.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
CONCLUSION.
</h3>

<p>
Rosa reached home on Wednesday morning.
Her bright smile had vanished, and her sweet
eyes looked sad and tearful; yet her step was
firm and her manner calm.  Lucy felt sure
when she met her sister, that she had found
support in this great trouble from that God
who bids us "cast all our care on Him, for He
careth for us."
</p>

<p>
When Rosa bent over Harty, and called him
by name, he looked strangely at her, and,
muttering, turned away.  At first this was
almost too much for her to bear; but by
degrees she became accustomed to it, and
commanded herself sufficiently to relieve
Mrs. Maxwell from her post as nurse.  Poor
Mrs. Maxwell was quite worn out, and was very
glad to take a little rest.  Lucy had darkened
her room, that she might sleep the better; and
as soon as the tired woman had lain down, she
stationed herself by the door to keep the hall
as quiet as possible.  Lucy found that she had
been unjust to Mrs. Maxwell.  She had always
thought her a stern woman with a cold heart;
but when she saw how tenderly she watched
by Harty's bedside, she felt that she should
always love her for it, and never call her cross
again, when she found fault about trifles.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell herself was surprised to find
how deeply she had become attached to
Dr. Vale's children.  She had met with much
misfortune and unkindness in the world; and
when she came to live in Dr. Vale's family,
she resolved to do her duty faithfully, and
did not expect to love those around her or
be loved by them.  Although her severe
manner had softened but little, by degrees she
had become so fond of the children that she
was only happy when doing something for
them; and now her anxiety for poor sick Harty
knew no bounds.
</p>

<p>
Several sad days of care and nursing passed
by.  Dr. Vale, Mrs. Maxwell, and Rosa, were
with Harty by turns, day and night; and Lucy
patiently waited on all until evening came,
when she slept soundly from pure weariness.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gillette was a comfort to all: he seemed
truly a messenger from his Master in heaven,
for there were ever sweet words of consolation
on his lips.  He daily offered prayers in
the room of the sick boy; and all who knelt
with him rose up strengthened by trust in the
God who "doeth all things well."
</p>

<p>
One day, when Harty had been ill a week,
Rosa was sitting by him in silence, when, in a
low, weak voice, he called her by name.
</p>

<p>
"My dear brother," she answered, very
calmly, although she was much startled.
</p>

<p>
He took the hand she placed on his, and
said, in a searching manner, "Am I very ill?"
</p>

<p>
"We hope you may get well, but you are
in God's hands," was Rosa's reply.
</p>

<p>
To be in God's hands was not an idea of
peace to poor Harty.  He could not turn with
loving trust in sickness to the God whom he
had neglected in health.  A pang darted through
his heart, a pang of fear and remorse, more
deep and painful than he had ever felt.  He
was to die with all the sins of his youth upon
him!  In his weak state this awful thought
was too much for him, and his mind again
wandered in delirium.
</p>

<p>
Rosa continued by his bedside in silent
prayer.  She did not again hear her name
called, as she hoped, and she was forced to
resign her place to Mrs. Maxwell, without
having another sign of consciousness from her
brother.
</p>

<p>
When it was again Rosa's turn to act as
nurse, she found that there had been a decided
change in Harty.  He slept more calmly, and
breathed more naturally.  Dr. Vale came in
when she had been sitting by the bed a
few moments: a rapid examination served
to show him that there was, indeed, cause
for hope.
</p>

<p>
The joyful news spread through the household,
and many thanksgivings went up to the
God who dispenses sickness and health.
Rejoiced as all were at the idea of seeing Harty
once more in health, there was in every heart
a deeper cause of gratitude: they might now
hope that he would not be called to meet
his Father in heaven while yet a disobedient,
wandering child.  Time might yet be given
him to learn, to know, and love that Father,
and walk in His holy ways.
</p>

<p>
When Harty was again conscious of what
was going on around him, his father was
with him.  "Don't trouble yourself to think
now, my dear boy," said Dr. Vale, soothingly.
"I hope you will soon be much better; and
I pray God that He will enable you to lead
a new life.  Lie still now, and you will soon
fall asleep again, to wake much refreshed, I
hope."
</p>

<p>
Harty's recovery was slow and tedious.  He
was very weak, and little inclined to talk.  He
seemed most contented when Rosa was singing
to him some pretty hymn, and Lucy was sitting
by him on the bed smoothing his hair, or
fanning him gently.
</p>

<p>
His large eyes looked sunken and thoughtful,
and his manner, once boisterous, was mild and
gentle.
</p>

<p>
"Don't move for me again this morning, dear
Lucy," he said one day; "your little feet must
be very tired with running up and down stairs.
When I get well I shall have to wait on you all
the rest of my life to repay you for this
kindness."
</p>

<p>
This was so unlike the old, exacting Harty,
that it quite overcame little Lucy, and the tears
were in her eyes as she answered, "I love to
do anything for you, my dear brother.  I want
nothing from you but to get well as soon as you
can, and look bright, and merry, and tease me
as you used to do."
</p>

<p>
A sad smile crossed Harty's face, as he said,
"I don't mean to do as I used to do in anything,
Lucy.  You will forget how unkind I was
to you, won't you, pet?  I don't think I shall
be so any more."
</p>

<p>
Lucy's tears fell fast.  Don't talk so, Harty,"
she said; "You were never unkind to me.  I
was a foolish little thing, and let everything
worry me.  Come, we won't talk any more; you
look tired.  Here is Rosa, she will sing,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Softly now the light of day,'&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
while you take a nice little nap."
</p>

<p>
By degrees the colour came again to Harty's
cheeks, and his limbs renewed their strength.
</p>

<p>
One calm Sunday evening, towards the end
of June, he was sitting between his sisters,
looking out at the evening sky.
</p>

<p>
"Let us have the Catechism once more,"
said Lucy; "it will seem like old times."
</p>

<p>
Rosa and Lucy began as usual together.
Harty's voice was with them; and there was a
deep solemnity in his manner as he pronounced
the words, "Yes, verily, and by God's help so
I will; and I heartily thank our Heavenly
Father that He has called me to this state of
salvation, through Jesus Christ our Lord; and
I pray unto God to give me His grace that I
may continue in the same unto my life's end."
</p>

<p>
His sisters felt that he spoke from his heart;
and there was that joy in their hearts which the
angels know over "one sinner that repenteth."
</p>

<p>
As the summer passed away, the cottage
looked cheerful once more, as of old.  The
children again rambled in the woods or strolled
in the orchard, and whenever their voices were
heard the tones were pleasant and kindly.
</p>

<p>
True, they all had faults of character still to
overcome, and were sometimes tempted to go
astray; but there was in each heart an earnest
wish to do right, and a spirit of love and
forgiveness that kept them from all variance.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maxwell was still formal and particular;
but she now had little cause for complaint, for
Harty was so grateful for her watchful care
during his illness, that he made many efforts to
overcome his careless habits, and in a great
measure succeeded.
</p>

<p>
"The dear boy forgot for once," she would
sometimes say, as she hung his cap on the
accustomed peg, or overlooked some act of
heedlessness; for she felt that he was trying to
please her, and she was the more ready to
forgive him.
</p>

<p>
In the trying scenes by Harty's bedside
Dr. Vale had been brought near in heart to his
children.  Now there was no subject on which
he could not talk freely to them.  He spoke to
them of their mother, and told them anecdotes
of her blameless life that were treasured up in
their young hearts for loving imitation.
</p>

<p>
The blessed Saviour and the heaven He purchased
for His faithful ones were often subjects
for conversation in that happy family circle,
and the doctor felt, as he looked into the faces
of his children, that God had blessed their
mother's prayers.
</p>

<p>
Uncle Gillette's letters were always welcomed
with joy, and never read without cheering the
young Christians in the path of duty.
</p>

<p>
Lucy had now nothing to fear: the sorrows
of her timid childhood were over.  Loving and
cheerful, she made all happy around her.  She
had found a comfort for all sorrow, a Friend
ever-present, a support for life and death, in
Him who saith to the children of His love,
"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's
good pleasure to give you the kingdom."

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
